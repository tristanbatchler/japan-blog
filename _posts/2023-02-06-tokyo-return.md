# Day 16: Back to Tokyo

When we woke up in our futons at the ryokan in Yudanaka, we planned to visit the onsen downstairs. Unfortunately, Sophie was too tired, and Tristan found out it didn't open until nine. So, we spent the morning relaxing, packing, drinking tea in the sunroom while admiring the clear view of the mountains.

When we checked out, the owner gave us adorable little ribbons with five yen coins to tie to our bags. We then headed to the station, but not before the owner insisted on taking a group photo with us. He set up a digital camera on a timer, and just as it was about to go off, he shouted "Monkey!" instead of "Cheese!" We were caught off guard and couldn't join in, but it was hilarious. 

He even tried to sell us some t-shirts before we left. We politely declined, eager to continue our journey. We were relieved when he didn't offer to drive us to the station, as we weren't too keen on getting back into his death trap of a car. 

And so, our adventure continues. We're learning, laughing, and loving every minute of it. Stay tuned for more of our travel tales!

As we prepare to leave Yudanaka, we're planning to have a chill night. We're looking forward to a quiet evening, perhaps with a good book or a movie, before we pack our bags and head off to our next destination. We're excited about the adventures that await us, but we're also a little sad to be leaving this weird and wonderful place behind.

After walking back to Yudanaka station for the last time, a friendly station attendant helped us purchase our tickets to Nagano. We had a bit of a wait for our train, so we grabbed some pizza buns and hot tea from Lawson. The line to board the train was a bit confusing, and we ended up switching lines a few times before finally boarding. 

Once on the train, we found that Tristan's luggage fit in the overhead carry area, but Sophie's didn't. So, we had to sit separately, with Sophie next to her luggage. The train ride was a pleasant 45 minutes with some great views. We arrived in Nagano and navigated our way out of the station, got some Shinkansen tickets, and used our JR Pass for the last time. 

We had to settle for a three-seater as there were no two-seaters left. Thankfully, no one sat next to us, and we enjoyed a peaceful ride. We got off near Tokyo and transferred to another train to get to Shibuya. The ticketing system was a bit confusing, but we managed to figure it out and made it to Shibuya station without any issues. 

Once we left the station, we found it quite busy, possibly due to some construction. Sophie started feeling a bit off, but we chalked it up to tiredness. We explored the area a bit, had a funny encounter with a security guard who seemed to want to stop us from walking down a particular street. To make matters worse, she was extremely confused when Tristan told her "we don't speak English" (he meant to say "Japanese"!), and then headed back to our hotel feeling silly and embarrassed. 

Sophie was feeling worse by this point, so she took a long bath and rested while Tristan unpacked. We decided to venture out again for some food and shopping. We visited Bic Camera, which was a bit overwhelming with its multiple levels and variety of products. We managed to find what we needed and then headed to a burger place called The Great Burger Stand.

The food was good, and we enjoyed some plant-based options. However, Sophie was feeling even worse by this point, so we headed back to the hotel. She had a rough night, and Tristan didn't sleep much either due to the small bed and the loud air conditioning. 

# Day 17: A day of rest
The next day, Sophie was still not feeling well, and we had pre-booked tickets to Team Labs. Without thinking logically, we decided it would be better if Tristan went by himself even though we would have loved to experience it together. With a heavy heart, Tristan got ready and began to leave for Team Labs on his own. Meanwhile, Sophie had a moment of clarity and thought to check if we could rebook for Friday. It turns out we could, and we managed to rebook our tickets! We were really hoping Sophie would feel better by then, but we were both so relieved we avoided Tristan having to go alone. We missed out on the cost of the tickets, but we didn't mind one bit. 

We decided to stay in and watch some movies. We decided to stay in and watch New People, Chef, and then Julie and Julia. It was a pretty chill day, we didn't interact much with anyone else. We did manage to venture out for a short walk to Macca's, grabbed a meal, split it between us, and enjoyed it by a nearby stream. Sophie was starting to feel a bit better, but we didn't want to push it. 

# Day 18: Studio Ghibli Museum
The next day, we woke up early because we had tickets to the Studio Ghibli Museum. Sophie was feeling much better, so we grabbed our favorite breakfast from Doutor - cheese toast, apple juice for me, and a hot coffee for Tristan. We then realized we needed our tickets to get into the museum, which were hidden amongst our pile of receipts. After a bit of a scramble, we found them and headed off to Shibuya Station.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/tokyo-return/2" %}

After a nice walk through a park in Mitaka, we finally made it to the museum, and we were so excited when I saw the giant Totoro in the ticket booth. There was already a line of excited people waiting to get in, and the energy was infectious.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/tokyo-return/3" %}

We were a bit nervous about our tickets because we had used a bit of a workaround to get them. Usually, tickets aren't available to foreigners unless you buy them on a specific day, and they sell out quickly. But we managed to get ours by using a VPN to appear as if we were in Japan. We ordered the tickets from the Japanese Studio Ghibli website and picked them up at Lawson's at the start of the trip. Thankfully, our little trick worked, and we got in without much issue, although the Lawson attendant was definitely suspicious of Tristan when he couldn't remember how to write his name in Japanese. Luckily, our tickets were valid without any issues and we were suddenly stepping into the magical world of Studio Ghibli!

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/tokyo-return/4" %}

Inside the museum, it was like stepping into another world. There were three stories filled with history, storyboards, and models of the animators' rooms. We even got to watch a short film about a little spider that lives underwater. It was a magical experience, and after exploring everything the museum had to offer, we decided to get some lunch at the Straw Hat Cafe and headed to the gift shop to pick up some souvenirs. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/tokyo-return/5" %}

After saying our goodbyes to the museum, we took a leisurely stroll through the park, heading back to our hotel. Along the way, we encountered a woman with her cat, which was a delightful sight. But the real stars of our walk were the ducks we spotted in the lake.

There were so many of them, and they were doing the most fascinating things. One particular type of duck, black and white in color, would dive underwater to forage for food. It was amazing to watch them swim down, disappearing completely from sight, only to resurface moments later. They'd stay up for a few seconds, then dive back down again. It was like watching a live nature documentary!

Then there were the other ducks that couldn't dive as deep. Instead, they'd tip their bodies, inverting themselves so that their feet were in the air. They'd bob around like that for a bit before righting themselves. It was hilarious and endearing at the same time.

We must have spent a good 15 minutes just watching these ducks, completely enthralled by their antics. It was a simple, unexpected joy that added a special touch to our day. It's these little moments that make travel so rewarding, don't you think?

On the way back, we visited a few vintage clothing stores, but didn't end up buying anything. We just enjoyed browsing and seeing what was on offer.

We also stumbled upon another B-side label store, the same sticker store we had visited in Osaka. We did another round in there, just to make sure we weren't missing out on any cool stickers or t-shirts. The staff were really friendly and even gave us a business card. We didn't end up buying anything, but it was still a fun experience.

Afterwards, we found our way back to the train station and headed back to our hotel in Shibuya. We decided to take it easy for the rest of the day, watching a few episodes of "Cook at all Costs", a show we had made a habit of making fun of during our trip, since it isn't the best show (or even a good one), but it was entertaining enough to keep us occupied.

Later in the evening, we decided to try out a sushi place for dinner. It was a bit of a mission to find it, as it was located in a large department building and Google Maps wasn't very helpful in indicating which level it was on. After a bit of wandering around, we finally found it and joined the long line of people waiting to get in.

The sushi place was quite an experience. The menu was on an iPad and when you ordered something, it would take a while for it to come out. But when it did, it would arrive on a little train, which was quite cute. Unfortunately, the vegetarian options were quite limited, which was a bit disappointing. But we still enjoyed the experience and the food was reasonably priced.

After dinner, we decided to take a stroll around Shibuya, taking in the night scenery. We even found a cool little food area under a bridge, which was a bit scary at first, but turned out to be quite interesting. We took some photos, got some snacks from a vending machine, and just enjoyed the rest of our evening.

# Day 19: Asakusa
The next day, we woke up early and decided to revisit Shibuya Sky, a tall building with a great view of the city. We had been there before during the day, but we wanted to see what it looked like at night. Unfortunately, the best spots were taken up by people with tripods, filming time lapses, so we didn't get to take many photos. But it was still a nice experience.

We decided to visit Asakusa, a neighborhood we hadn't explored yet, and hoping to visit some temples and Tokyo Skytree. We took the train there and found ourselves in a bustling area full of shops and restaurants. We wandered around for a bit, taking in the sights and sounds, and then decided to grab some lunch. There we stumbled upon this little food stall that was selling these delicious looking skewers of dango, which is a type of Japanese dumpling made from rice flour. 

After our little snack, we continued our exploration of Asakusa. We found ourselves in this bustling shopping street called Nakamise. It was lined with all sorts of shops selling traditional Japanese crafts, snacks, and souvenirs. We had a blast just wandering around, taking in the sights and sounds, and of course, doing a bit of shopping.

[Part about the temple and the Skytree missing?]

We decided to try out Japanese Domino's. We've been curious about it for a while, so we thought, why not? I ordered the Ultra Cheese and Sophie went for the Big Dack, a burger-themed pizza that's all about Big Mac energy. They can't call it that, of course, so they went with Big Dack. Sophie found the name so ridiculous that she refused to say it when ordering, instead just pointing at the picture on the menu. 

After a short wait, we grabbed our pizzas and headed to the Skytree area. We found a free table in the surrounding gardens and had a little pizza picnic. It was cold and dark by then, but we didn't mind. Sophie even tried maple syrup on her pizza, which was nice but a bit too sweet by the end. My pizza was just fine - it was Domino's after all. 

Since there are hardly any bins in Japan, we had to carry our pizza boxes around in our bag. We then climbed four giant sets of stairs to get to the ice skating rink. It was quite expensive - 4,200 yen for everything, including socks and gloves which we didn't have, and the skates and entry fee. But we thought it was worth it for the experience of skating near the Tokyo Skytree. 

The staff were lovely and helped us find our shoe sizes. We got a 100 yen coin locker for our bag and shoes, and then put on our skates. My shoes were a bit too small, and I felt like a baby deer on the ice. It was so foreign and I felt like I was going to slip over at any time. Sophie hadn't skated for ages either, so she was also out of her element. 

We tried to skate, but it was hard. Even the instructor came over to us and said that our shoes were too big around the ankles, which was dangerous. We tried to continue, but my ankles started hurting and Sophie was finding it too scary. After two laps of the small rink, we decided to call it a day. 

We returned our skates, got our stuff back, and took some photos and videos with the Skytree before we left. On our way out, we discovered a Studio Ghibli store. It was so cool! Sophie got a Kiki's Delivery Service headband and we also got a Spirited Away surprise capsule toy. 

We then took the subway back to Shibuya. It was a direct line from the Skytree, which was lucky. We even managed to get seats, which is a rare luxury in Japan. 

Back in Shibuya, we stopped at a FamilyMart near our hotel for some drinks. We sat outside the FamilyMart one last time before we leave, just like we used to do when we first got here. 

Back at the hotel, we had a nice bath and then sat down to record this podcast. We'll see you tomorrow or the next day for our final recap on this trip. Bye!

# Day 20: Last day in Japan and TeamLab
Our last official day in Japan started with a bit of a laundry mishap. We had put a load of washing in the night before, hoping it would be dry by morning. But, in our tiredness, we forgot to put it on a second dry cycle. Tristan woke up in a panic, realizing our clothes were still wet, and we had a busy day ahead. In a rush, he put it on what he thought was a dry cycle, but it turned out to be another wash cycle. So, our clothes ended up even wetter than before!

With a full load of sopping wet clothes and a ticking clock, we had to think on our feet. We packed our wet clothes into a plastic bag from Domino's and stuffed it into Tristan's suitcase, hoping it wouldn't leak. We then asked the hotel reception to hold our bags while we went to TeamLab, a digital art museum we had been looking forward to visiting.

We left our luggage, heavy with wet clothes, at the hotel and headed out into the snow, a sight we hadn't seen before in Tokyo. We grabbed our final breakfast at Dotonbori and then made our way to Shibuya Station. We hopped on a couple of trains and even got to ride the monorail to TeamLab's, which was a fun little detour.

At TeamLab's, we were greeted by a huge line of people waiting to get in. We waited for about 20 minutes before we could scan our tickets and enter. Once inside, we were ushered into a black room where we had to take off our shoes and store our belongings in a locker. The only things we kept with us were our phones and cameras, ready to capture the magic of TeamLab's.

The first part of the exhibit was the water section. We walked up a small hill with water rushing down, which was a sensory delight. The rooms were dark, with only red lights at the bottom to guide our way. We saw projections of koi fish and flowers in knee-deep water, giant inflatable balls that changed color when touched, and a room filled with real orchids hanging from the ceiling. The visuals were stunning, and we spent a good amount of time just soaking it all in.

After our visit to TeamLab's, we grabbed burgers at the Great Burger Stand before heading back to the hotel to collect our luggage. We then found a nearby laundromat to dry our clothes. It was a bit of a struggle lugging our heavy bags in the rain, but we managed. We're now waiting for our clothes to dry, hoping we won't have to do another cycle. Depending on how quickly our clothes dry, we'll either catch the 4:15 or 5:15 train.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/tokyo-return/9" %}

We're not going to sugarcoat it, the laundry mishap has been a huge bummer, and we're absolutely drenched from the freezing rain we had to walk through to the laundromat! But hey, we're still in high spirits because the hard part is over (or so we think). Now, all we have to do is wait for our clothes to dry and catch our train. We're crossing our fingers and hoping we'll breeze through customs without any hitches. 

We're currently in cool-down mode, taking a breather and just soaking in the experience. We're learning as we go, and even though we're a bit wet and weary, we're still having the time of our lives.
