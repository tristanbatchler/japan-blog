# Day 16: Back to Tōkyō

When we woke up in our futons at the ryokan in Yamanouchi, we planned to visit the onsen downstairs. Sadly, it was closed (boo). So, we spent the morning relaxing, packing, drinking tea in the sunroom while admiring the clear view of the mountains.

When we checked out, the owner gave us adorable little ribbons with five yen coins to tie to our bags. We then headed to the station, but not before the owner insisted on taking a group photo with us. He set up a digital camera on a timer, and just as it was about to go off, he shouted "Monkey!" instead of "Cheese!" We were caught off guard and couldn't join in, but it was hilarious. He didn't like how the first picture turned out so he took another one too!

He even tried to sell us some t-shirts before we left. We politely declined, eager to continue our journey. We were relieved when he didn't offer to drive us to the station, as we weren't too keen on getting back into his death trap of a car. We were excited to explore more of Tōkyō, but we were also a little sad to be leaving this weird and wonderful place behind.

After walking back to Yudanaka station for the last time, a friendly station attendant helped us purchase our tickets to Nagano. We had a bit of a wait for our train, so we grabbed some pizza buns and hot tea from Lawson. The line to board the train was a bit confusing, and we ended up switching lines a few times before finally boarding. 

Once on the train, we found that Tristan's luggage fit in the overhead carry area, but Soph's didn't. So, we had to sit separately, with Soph next to her luggage. The train ride was a pleasant 45 minutes with some great views. We revived the drawing game we made up before our flight to Japan a few weeks before -- Tristan drew a very accurate portrait of Dave Grohl in just one minute. It belongs in the Louvre! We arrived in Nagano and navigated our way out of the station, got some Shinkansen tickets, and used our JR Pass for the last time.

We had to settle for a three-seater as there were no two-seaters left. Thankfully, no one sat next to us, and we enjoyed a peaceful ride. We got off near Tōkyō and transferred to another train to get to Shibuya (渋谷区). The ticketing system was a bit confusing, but we managed to figure it out and made it to Shibuya Station without any issues. 

The station was quite busy -- lots of construction pushed lots of people into only a few walkways, so it was tricky to navigate with our luggage. Soph started feeling a bit off, but we chalked it up to tiredness. We explored the area a bit, had a funny encounter with a security guard who seemed to want to stop us from walking down a particular street. To make matters worse, she was extremely confused when Tristan told her "we don't speak English" (he meant to say "Japanese"!).

Soph was feeling worse by this point, so she took a long bath and rested while Tristan unpacked. We decided to venture out again for some food and shopping. We visited Bic Camera, which was a bit overwhelming with its multiple levels and variety of products. We managed to find what we needed and then headed to a burger place called The Great Burger Stand. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/tokyo-return/1" %}

The food was good, and we enjoyed some plant-based options. However, Soph was feeling even worse by this point, so we headed back to the hotel. She had a rough night, and Tristan didn't sleep much either due to the small bed and the loud air conditioning. 

# Day 17: A day of rest
The next day, Soph was still not feeling well, and we had pre-booked tickets to Team Labs Planets. We decided it would be better if Tristan went by himself even though we would have loved to experience it together. With a heavy heart, Tristan got ready and began to leave for Team Labs on his own. Meanwhile, Soph had a moment of clarity and thought to check if we could rebook for Friday morning. It turns out we could, and we managed to rebook our tickets! We were really hoping Soph would feel better by then, but we were both so relieved we avoided Tristan having to go alone. We weren't able to get a refund for our original tickets, but it was a small price to pay to ensure we could go together.

We decided to stay in and watch some movies. We decided to stay in and watch New People, Chef, and then Julie and Julia. Japanese Netflix is very weird.

It was a pretty chill day, we didn't interact much with anyone else. We did manage to venture out for a short walk to Macca's for lunch and enjoyed it next to a nearby stream. Soph was starting to feel a bit better, but we didn't want to push it. 

# Day 18: Studio Ghibli Museum
The next day, we woke up early because we had tickets to the Ghibli Museum (Mitaka no Mori Jiburi Bijutsukan, 三鷹の森ジブリ美術館). Soph was finally on the mend, so we grabbed our favorite breakfast from Doutor. We then realized we needed our tickets to get into the museum, which were hidden amongst our pile of receipts. After a bit of a scramble, we found them and headed off to Shibuya Station.

After a nice walk through a park in Mitaka, we finally made it to the museum, and we were so excited when I saw the giant Totoro in the ticket booth. There was already a line of excited people waiting to get in, and the energy was infectious.

We were a bit nervous about our tickets because we had used a bit of a workaround to get them. Usually, tickets aren't available to foreigners unless you buy them on a specific day, and they sell out quickly. But we managed to get ours by using a VPN to appear as if we were in Japan. We ordered the tickets from the Japanese Studio Ghibli website and picked them up at Lawson's at the start of the trip. Thankfully, our little trick worked, and we got in without much issue. And just like that, we were stepping into the magical world of Studio Ghibli!

Inside the museum, it was like stepping into another world. Sadly we couldn't take any photos inside, but there were three stories filled with early drawings, storyboards, and models of the animators' rooms. We even got to watch an exclusive short film about a little spider that lives underwater called Mon Mon the Water Spider (Mizugumo Monmon, 水グモもんもん). You can only watch it at the museum, and it had no words so anyone could enjoy it, no matter their background. It was a truly unforgettable experience. We were allowed to take pictures on the roof, which had an enormous statue of the giant robot gardener from Castle in the sky.

After exploring everything the museum had to offer (and spending way too much money at the gift shop), we decided to get some lunch at the Straw Hat Cafe. It's common in Japan to see plastic renditions of everything on a restaurant's menu, but the museum took it one step further and had knitted versions of their dishes. It was so cute and quirky!

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/tokyo-return/5-part-3" %}

After saying our goodbyes to the museum, we took a leisurely stroll through the park, heading back to our hotel. Along the way, we encountered a woman just casually walking her cat. But the real stars of our walk were the ducks we spotted in the lake.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/tokyo-return/5.1" %}

We were enthralled watching them swim underwater for food. It was so cool to watch them swim down, disappearing completely, only to resurface with a lil snack. They'd stay up for a few seconds, then dive back down again. Then there were the other ducks that couldn't dive as deep -- they'd bob around like that for a good five seconds or so, and then resurface (and presumably ask their Mum if she saw that). We must have spent a good 15 minutes just watching these ducks, completely captivated. It was a simple, unexpected joy that made our day just that little bit better. It's the little things. We don't deserve ducks!!

We walked through the park on our way back to the station. It was a really charming park and lots of people were out enjoying it despite it being a bit of a dreary day.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/tokyo-return/5.2" %}

On the way back, we visited a few vintage clothing stores, but didn't end up buying anything. We just enjoyed browsing and seeing what was on offer. We also stumbled upon another B-side label store, the same sticker store we had visited in Ōsaka. We did another round in there, just to make sure we weren't missing out on any cool stickers or t-shirts. The staff were really friendly and even gave us a business card, which is a kind gesture in Japan. We trotted back to the train station and headed back to our hotel in Shibuya.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/tokyo-return/5.3" %}

We decided to take it easy for the rest of the day, watching a few episodes of "Cook at all Costs" on Netflix. Basically, three contestants cook meals at different costs from their own budget and whoever cooks the best meal wins the money they have left. It was a bit gimmicky, but it was entertaining enough to keep us occupied.

We emerged from our hotel in the evening to secure some grub. We weren't super hungry, so we explored Shibuya and took the opportunity to take some nighttime snaps in the city.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/tokyo-return/5.4" %}

After working up an appetite, we decided to try out a sushi place for dinner that came highly recommended on Happy Cow (a vegan food app). It was a bit of a mission to find it -- it was nestled in a large department building and it was tricky finding what level it was on. After a bit of wandering around, we finally found it and joined the long line of people waiting to get in.

After waiting around 45 minutes, we were in. It was quite an experience -- the menu was on an iPad and when you ordered something, it would take a while for it to come out. But when it did, it would arrive on a little train that looked like a shinkansen -- adorbs. Unfortunately, the vegetarian options were quite limited despite Happy Cow's recommendation, which was disappointing. We ate what we could and cut our losses.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/tokyo-return/6" %}

We strolled around Shibuya a little longer before turning it in for the night. We were keen for our last full day in Japan. We were putting the mixed into mixed feelings about it -- we were a bit sad that our holiday was coming to an end, but we were also ready to return to our routine back in Aus (and our orange guy, of course).

# Day 19: Asakusa (浅草)
The next day, we woke up early and decided to revisit Shibuya Sky, a tall building with a great view of the city. We had been there before during the day, but we wanted to see what it looked like at night. Unfortunately, the best spots were taken up by people with tripods, filming time lapses, so we didn't get to take many photos. But it was still a nice experience.

We decided to visit Asakusa, a neighborhood we hadn't explored yet, and hoping to visit some temples and Tokyo Skytree. We took the train there and found ourselves in a bustling area full of shops and restaurants. We wandered around for a bit, taking in the sights and sounds, and then decided to grab some lunch. There we stumbled upon this little food stall that was selling these delicious looking skewers of dango, which is a type of Japanese dumpling made from rice flour. 

After our little snack, we continued our exploration of Asakusa. We found ourselves in this bustling shopping street called Nakamise. It was lined with all sorts of shops selling traditional Japanese crafts, snacks, and souvenirs. We had a blast just wandering around, taking in the sights and sounds, and of course, doing a bit of shopping.

[Part about the temple and the Skytree missing?]

We decided to try out Japanese Domino's. We've been curious about it for a while, so we thought, why not? I ordered the Ultra Cheese and Soph went for the Big Dack, a burger-themed pizza that's all about Big Mac energy. They can't call it that, of course, so they went with Big Dack. Soph found the name so ridiculous that she refused to say it when ordering, instead just pointing at the picture on the menu. 

After a short wait, we grabbed our pizzas and headed to the Skytree area. We found a free table in the surrounding gardens and had a little pizza picnic. It was cold and dark by then, but we didn't mind. Soph even tried maple syrup on her pizza, which was nice but a bit too sweet by the end. My pizza was just fine - it was Domino's after all. 

Since there are hardly any bins in Japan, we had to carry our pizza boxes around in our bag. We then climbed four giant sets of stairs to get to the ice skating rink. It was quite expensive - 4,200 yen for everything, including socks and gloves which we didn't have, and the skates and entry fee. But we thought it was worth it for the experience of skating near the Tokyo Skytree. 

The staff were lovely and helped us find our shoe sizes. We got a 100 yen coin locker for our bag and shoes, and then put on our skates. My shoes were a bit too small, and I felt like a baby deer on the ice. It was so foreign and I felt like I was going to slip over at any time. Soph hadn't skated for ages either, so she was also out of her element. 

We tried to skate, but it was hard. Even the instructor came over to us and said that our shoes were too big around the ankles, which was dangerous. We tried to continue, but my ankles started hurting and Soph was finding it too scary. After two laps of the small rink, we decided to call it a day. 

We returned our skates, got our stuff back, and took some photos and videos with the Skytree before we left. On our way out, we discovered a Studio Ghibli store. It was so cool! Soph got a Kiki's Delivery Service headband and we also got a Spirited Away surprise capsule toy. 

We then took the subway back to Shibuya. It was a direct line from the Skytree, which was lucky. We even managed to get seats, which is a rare luxury in Japan. 

Back in Shibuya, we stopped at a FamilyMart near our hotel for some drinks. We sat outside the FamilyMart one last time before we leave, just like we used to do when we first got here. 

Back at the hotel, we had a nice bath and then sat down to record this podcast. We'll see you tomorrow or the next day for our final recap on this trip. Bye!

# Day 20: Last day in Japan and TeamLab
Our last official day in Japan started with a bit of a laundry mishap. We had put a load of washing in the night before, hoping it would be dry by morning. But, in our tiredness, we forgot to put it on a second dry cycle. Tristan woke up in a panic, realizing our clothes were still wet, and we had a busy day ahead. In a rush, he put it on what he thought was a dry cycle, but it turned out to be another wash cycle. So, our clothes ended up even wetter than before!

With a full load of sopping wet clothes and a ticking clock, we had to think on our feet. We packed our wet clothes into a plastic bag from Domino's and stuffed it into Tristan's suitcase, hoping it wouldn't leak. We then asked the hotel reception to hold our bags while we went to TeamLab, a digital art museum we had been looking forward to visiting.

We left our luggage, heavy with wet clothes, at the hotel and headed out into the snow, a sight we hadn't seen before in Tokyo. We grabbed our final breakfast at Dotonbori and then made our way to Shibuya Station. We hopped on a couple of trains and even got to ride the monorail to TeamLab's, which was a fun little detour.

At TeamLab's, we were greeted by a huge line of people waiting to get in. We waited for about 20 minutes before we could scan our tickets and enter. Once inside, we were ushered into a black room where we had to take off our shoes and store our belongings in a locker. The only things we kept with us were our phones and cameras, ready to capture the magic of TeamLab's.

The first part of the exhibit was the water section. We walked up a small hill with water rushing down, which was a sensory delight. The rooms were dark, with only red lights at the bottom to guide our way. We saw projections of koi fish and flowers in knee-deep water, giant inflatable balls that changed color when touched, and a room filled with real orchids hanging from the ceiling. The visuals were stunning, and we spent a good amount of time just soaking it all in.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/tokyo-return/8" %}

After our visit to TeamLab's, we grabbed burgers at the Great Burger Stand before heading back to the hotel to collect our luggage. We then found a nearby laundromat to dry our clothes. It was a bit of a struggle lugging our heavy bags in the rain, but we managed. We're now waiting for our clothes to dry, hoping we won't have to do another cycle. Depending on how quickly our clothes dry, we'll either catch the 4:15 or 5:15 train.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/tokyo-return/9" %}

We're not going to sugarcoat it, the laundry mishap has been a huge bummer, and we're absolutely drenched from the freezing rain we had to walk through to the laundromat! But hey, we're still in high spirits because the hard part is over (or so we think). Now, all we have to do is wait for our clothes to dry and catch our train. We're crossing our fingers and hoping we'll breeze through customs without any hitches. 

We're currently in cool-down mode, taking a breather and just soaking in the experience. We're learning as we go, and even though we're a bit wet and weary, we're still having the time of our lives.
