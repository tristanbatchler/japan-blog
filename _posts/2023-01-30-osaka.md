# Day 10: Arriving at Ōsaka • 大阪
We started our day in Kyoto, waking up around eight o'clock. Tristan had a fantastic sleep on the futon, but poor Sophie was nursing a small back injury from lifting luggage, so her sleep wasn't as restful. We had to rush a bit in the morning as the checkout time was 10am, an hour earlier than we were used to. We packed up, tidied the place, and had a quick breakfast. I indulged in curry while Sophie opted for a cream puff. Our host instructed us to leave the kitchen tap running ever so slightly to prevent the pipes from freezing, which was a very foreign concept to us.

We then embarked on a 15-minute walk to Sanjo Station. Our route was simple: one train for 450 yen that would take us straight to a station in Osaka. The journey was about 45 minutes, and despite our initial nervousness about possibly being in a reserved seating carriage, we made it without any hiccups.

Once we arrived at the station, our GPS threw us for a loop, insisting there was one more stop. But the conductor quickly set us straight, and we hopped off and onto a subway. The transfer was easy, and for 600 yen each, we felt it was a great value. 

We left our bags at our hotel and set out to explore Dotonbori. We treated ourselves to cheesy pancakes for 500 yen each. Tristan found them a bit bland and overhyped, but Sophie, the queen of bland, loved them. We had a bit of a mix-up with the ticket machine and the server, but we eventually got our pancakes and moved on.

We spent the rest of the day exploring manga stores, trading card stores, and even a retro video game store. We found some old Game Boys, including a limited edition Pokemon one, but decided to hold off on any purchases.

As we were heading back to our hotel, a young Japanese woman who was standing next to us at the lights gave us a small Pokemon figurine. We're not sure why, but we think she might have gotten it from a capsule toy machine and didn't want it. It was a random but delightful encounter that brightened our day. 

Back at the hotel, we checked in and settled into our room. The bath wasn't as nice as our last place, but it was still a bath, so we were happy. The view was just another building, but we didn't mind. We're just excited to be here, exploring and experiencing new things. 

After checking into our hotel and chilling for a bit, we decided to explore the local scene. We were lured downstairs by the promise of free drinks, only to find self-serve soft drink vending machines. A bit of a letdown, but hey, we got our fair share of ginger ale and other fizzy delights. We also discovered that the breakfast bar had some promising options like bagels and toast. We didn't get to try them yet, but we made a mental note to check out the prices for breakfast.

Our next stop was supposed to be an Australian pub we'd found online, but alas, it was closed. We were a bit bummed out, especially since the website had promised it would be open. But, as we've learned, travel is all about adapting, so we decided to try out a random place that promised cold beer. It turned out to be more of an oyster bar, and while the lime sour and beer were decent, the grilled corn was overpriced. We left there feeling a bit like we'd been taken for a ride.

But then, we hit the jackpot. We found Oko, a vegan/vegetarian Okonomiyaki place, and it was absolutely delicious. We arrived a bit early and had a minor debate about whether we should wait a few minutes before going in. Sophie won that round, and we headed up to find only one person ahead of us in line. The owner, who runs the entire place by herself, was super accommodating and even helped us find a spot that would work for us.

We ordered vegan gyoza and vegetarian okonomiyaki, which was loaded with potatoes, carrots, asparagus, spinach, and green onions. We also opted for full cheese, which meant our okonomiyaki was smothered in American cheese. Tristan went for the teriyaki chicken okonomiyaki with half cheese. The drinks were a steal at 180 yen (about $2 Australian), and we filled up on Asahi beer, whiskey highball, and a mysterious clear liquid that tasted like a vodka mix.

We left Oko feeling pretty tipsy and full of praise for the owner. We even managed to embarrass ourselves a bit by gushing about how amazing everything was. But hey, when you find the best gyoza and okonomiyaki you've ever had, you've got to let the world know, right?

On our way back to the hotel, we stopped by Family Mart for more drinks and picked up something from Lush for our baths. We also got a facial moisturizer for Tristan because, well, he deserves it. We strolled through Dotonbori, took some pictures, and even stopped by Starbucks to check out some potential gifts for our friend Aaron.

Tomorrow, we're off to Universal Studios, so stay tuned for more of our adventures. Until then, sayonara!

# Day 11: Universal Studios Japan
Our day started early, around 6:30 AM, with a refreshing hot shower and a quick prep for our much-anticipated visit to Universal Studios. We grabbed some snacks from Lawson and hopped on a train, excited for the day ahead. But, as luck would have it, our GPS decided to play tricks on us, and we ended up getting off too early. Lesson learned: always cross-check the GPS location with the actual station names. Despite the minor hiccup, we only lost about 15 minutes and made it to Universal Studios by 8:30 AM.

We waited eagerly at the entrance for about 45 minutes before they let us in. We even helped a group of fellow Westerners snap a photo in front of the Universal Studios gates. A quick tip for future travelers: it's worth getting to the entrance super early, at least 40 minutes before opening. If you're traveling with JTB, you get to enter 30 minutes earlier than everyone else and enjoy the rides before the crowd pours in.

Our first ride of the day was the Hollywood Dream. But, we hit a snag. One of the staff members pulled us aside and led us to a locker room with a test seat for the ride. Tristan fit in just fine, but I, Sophie, didn't. The harness wouldn't go all the way down. It was a bit of a blow, to be honest. I've never not fit into a rollercoaster seat before. It was embarrassing, and I shed a few tears behind a closed stall. It was hands down the worst part of our trip so far.

After pulling myself together, we decided to stay and make the most of our day. We had paid a good amount of money to be there, and leaving would have just made the day worse. We found out that other plus-size people had better experiences with other rides, so we decided to give it another shot.

Our next ride was the Spider-Man ride, a mostly VR experience that was absolutely thrilling. We had a fast track, so we didn't have to wait long. The seats were comfortable, and the ride was a blast. It reminded us of how fun rides can be and made us eager to try more.

We then ventured into Super Nintendo World, which was a sight to behold. The surroundings and props were impressive, straight out of a Mario game. We tried the Koopa's Challenge ride, a Mario Kart virtual reality ride. It was fun, but not as good as the Spider-Man ride. We also tried to get on the Yoshi's Ride, but unfortunately, I didn't fit into the seat again.

Despite the setbacks, we're still having a great time exploring and learning. We're taking everything in stride and looking forward to more adventures. Stay tuned for more of our travel escapades!
We were all huddled together in this dimly lit room, surrounded by shelves filled with wand boxes. The actor, who was playing the role of Ollivander, was speaking in English but with a Japanese translator by his side. He was explaining the importance of the wand choosing the wizard, not the other way around. 

Suddenly, he pointed at a young Japanese girl in the crowd and asked her to come forward. He handed her a wand and asked her to perform a simple spell. The girl, looking a bit nervous, waved the wand and said the spell. Suddenly, a shelf full of wand boxes tumbled down! Ollivander quickly took the wand back, assuring her that it wasn't the right one for her. 

He then handed her another wand and asked her to try again. This time, when she waved the wand, the room lit up with a warm glow and a gust of wind blew through the room. Ollivander declared that the wand had chosen her. It was a magical moment, even though we knew it was all part of the show. 

After the show, we were led into the wand shop where we could purchase our own wands. We spent a good amount of time there, looking at all the different wands from the Harry Potter series. In the end, I decided to get Hermione's wand because I've always admired her character. Sophie, on the other hand, chose a wand based on her birth month, as per the Celtic calendar, which was a nice touch.

After our wand shopping, we decided to explore the rest of the Harry Potter World. We walked around Hogsmeade, taking in the sights and sounds. We even got to see the Hogwarts Express, which was a real treat. 

We ended our day at Universal Studios Japan with a visit to the Three Broomsticks for some dinner. We shared a platter of traditional British fare - fish and chips, shepherd's pie, and a side of vegetables. It was the perfect end to our magical day at the park.

Looking back, we had such a blast exploring Universal Studios Japan. From the slightly underwhelming Super Nintendo World to the thrilling Jurassic World ride, and finally, the magical Harry Potter World, it was an adventure we'll never forget. Despite the language barrier and the occasional mishaps, we managed to navigate our way around and make the most of our day. 

We can't wait to share more of our travel adventures with you. Until then, happy travels!
We had a blast at Universal Studios Japan, even though we had a few hiccups along the way. We started our day with a magical experience at the Harry Potter section of the park. We watched a wand choosing ceremony, where a British actor with a fantastic accent pulled a random person from the crowd and went through the process of finding the perfect wand for them. It was a fun spectacle, with lights exploding and items moving around the store. The chosen person even got to keep the wand that was a good fit for them. 

We then ventured into the wand shop, where we had planned to buy our own wands. I had taken a quiz on the train ride there that matched our personalities to specific wands. Mine was supposed to be Ebony with Phoenix hair, 12 and a half inches long. Unfortunately, they were out of stock of Ebony wands. After some consideration, I decided not to buy a wand at all. They were quite expensive and I realized it would probably just end up collecting dust on my shelf at home. 

We then moved on to the merchandise section. I was tempted to buy a Hufflepuff scarf, but Tristan reminded me that I could probably knit one myself. So, we decided to save our money and just bought a small time turner magnet as a souvenir. 

Next, we decided to go on the Jaws ride. It was a fun experience, with our boat being hunted by a giant shark. The captain of our boat was a real character, shooting at the shark with a shotgun and creating a lot of excitement. 

After the ride, we tried to make a reservation for skiing lessons over the phone. Unfortunately, we ran into some language barriers and weren't able to make the reservation. We decided to look online for other options, but we weren't too upset about it. We figured we could always go tobogganing or something else fun if we couldn't find skiing lessons. 

To celebrate our unsuccessful attempt at making a reservation, we treated ourselves to some delicious pork ribs. We then decided to get some pizza for dinner. We ordered four slices, expecting them to be Australian-sized slices. However, we were surprised when we were given four box sets, each containing a quarter of a pizza and a drink. It was a bit of a miscommunication, but we decided to just go with it and enjoy our meal. 

Despite the language barriers and a few minor setbacks, we had a great time at Universal Studios Japan. We learned a lot, had some fun experiences, and made some great memories. We can't wait to see what the rest of our trip has in store for us!
After our pizza shop debacle, we decided to wander around a bit more, checking out the last of the shops. But honestly, most of the stuff was pretty gimmicky. The shirts weren't printed well and it all felt a bit like a tourist trap. So, we left the park with just a magnet, memories, pictures, and bellies full of food we didn't really want. Despite the ups and downs, we both agreed it was a good day overall. 

I was particularly proud of myself for handling a tough experience in the morning. I allowed myself to feel upset, took the time I needed to process my feelings, and then made a logical decision about whether to stay or go. I was so grateful to have Tristan there to talk it out with. If I'd been alone, I would have left in a heartbeat, feeling completely unwelcome. But we stayed, and we had some good experiences on rides, met some nice people, and had some good food. 

We left the park and wandered into a Gap store, which was a first for me. Nothing really caught my eye, so we hopped on the train and headed home. During our transfer from the train to the subway, we faced a choice: take the escalator or climb three flights of big steps. I decided to take the stairs, and Tristan joined me. It was tough, but I made it to the top and felt really proud of myself. 

I realized that I can't base my self-worth on whether or not I can fit in a roller coaster seat that was made for people much smaller than me. I have a lot to offer this world, and my body has nothing to do with that. 

We also had a funny experience with a really scary ride called Dinosaur. It looked like you went upside down for half the ride, and I was apprehensive about going on it. But I decided to see if I could fit in the chair. The staff member was super nice and tried to make it work, but it just wasn't happening. I was actually relieved because I didn't really want to go on the ride. The staff member was really cool about it and said something reassuring that none of the other people had said. He said the ride was made for Japanese people, not implying that it was my fault for not fitting. 

So, despite some hard lessons, we learned a lot. Now we're just going to relax, enjoy the rest of the day, and prepare for our last full day in Osaka. We're keen to have a good shopping day and maybe get some gifts for other people. Until next time!

# Day 12: Shopping in Osaka

Yesterday, we had a bit of a late start, waking up around 9:30 am. It was our shopping day, so we got ready and headed out to Dotonbori. Sophie had her heart set on a cheese coin, and Tristan was all about the takoyaki, but alas, we were a bit short on coin change. So, we decided to give that a miss and instead, we strolled through Dotonbori, popping into a few shops. Unfortunately, nothing really caught our eye, mainly because there weren't many plus-size clothing options. 

We then made our way to America Mura, but not before stopping at Don Quixote. This place was a treasure trove! Sophie found some lipstick, and Tristan managed to snag a hat that actually fit his huge head. We also picked up some new earrings. The shop was massive, with six floors of goodies. Checking out was a bit of a challenge with the long lines and the tax-free confusion, but we managed to save about 10% on our purchases, which was a win!

Next, we stumbled upon this adorable sticker shop in Amerikumura called B-side label. They had so many unique designs, and I even found a shirt that I absolutely loved. The lady at the checkout was incredibly sweet and seemed genuinely impressed with our attempts at speaking Japanese. She even gifted us a free sticker as a token of appreciation from the people of Japan.

We continued our shopping spree, exploring vintage clothing stores and finding a cute, colorful jumper from Paragraph. It was a bit pricey, but we found it cheaper in another shop, so Sophie decided to go for it. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/10" %}

After all that shopping, we were famished, so we hit up McDonald's. Tristan tried the barbecue soy sauce burger with bacon, and Sophie stuck to her fries and melon Fanta. We realized too late that we should have just ordered a meal, but hey, you live and you learn!

We decided to call it a day on the shopping front, having spent a bit more than we'd planned. Back at the hotel, we chilled out, did some laundry, and I even treated myself to a beer in the bath. 

For dinner, we decided to splurge on some Kobe beef at a place we found on TripAdvisor. It was a grill-your-own-meat kind of place, which was a fun experience. We ordered our meats from an iPad on the wall and enjoyed some mega lemon sours. Sophie even tried a piece of my Wagyu steak and admitted it was pretty good!

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/11" %}

We ended the night at an Australian pub, where we chatted with the owner, Osaka Jo, who had lived in Australia for five years. It was refreshing to have a full-on conversation in English with someone other than each other. We had lots of drinks, shared some Vegemite cheese toast, and even scored some free buttery nipple shots with some fellow Aussies. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/12" %} 

We stumbled back to our hotel around 12:30 am and crashed.
