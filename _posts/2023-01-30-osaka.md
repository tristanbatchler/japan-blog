# Day 10: Arriving at Ōsaka • 大阪
We started our day in Kyōto, waking up around 8:00 am. Tristan had a fantastic sleep on the futon, but Soph was still nursing a small back injury so her sleep wasn't as restful. We had to rush a bit in the morning as the checkout time was 10:00 am, an hour earlier than we were used to. We packed up, tidied the place, and had a quick breakfast. Tristan opted for leftover curry for breakfast while Soph had a cream puff. Our host instructed us to leave the kitchen tap running ever so slightly to prevent the pipes from freezing, which was a very foreign concept to us.

We then embarked on a 15-minute walk to Sanjō Station (三条駅). Our route was simple: one train for ¥450 that would take us straight to a station in Ōsaka. The journey was about 45 minutes, and despite a slight hiccup thinking we were in the wrong carriage, it was a pretty straightforward trip.

Once we arrived at the station, our GPS decided to sabotage us and wrongfully insisted there was one more stop. Thankfully the conductor quickly set us straight, and we hopped off and onto a subway. The transfer was easy, and for ¥600 each, it was a pretty cheap trip.

We checked in to our hotel, the [Vessel Inn Namba](https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/vessel-inn-namba.en-gb.html?aid=356980&label=gog235jc-1DCAsodUIQdmVzc2VsLWlubi1uYW1iYUgzWANoD4gBAZgBCbgBF8gBDNgBA-gBAYgCAagCA7gCvv-SpgbAAgHSAiRmZTgxMmFjZi0yZTk0LTRmYzMtYjAyYi02ODk4YzBiM2IwMDnYAgTgAgE&sid=00331bf60c828dd121ef44067c351ec3&dist=0&keep_landing=1&sb_price_type=total&type=total&), only 400 metres from Shinsaibashi Shopping Arcade (心斎橋筋) and close to the train station. We dropped off our bags and set out to explore Dōtonbori (道頓堀).

At the entrance of the shopping area was the [cheese coin](https://en.japantravel.com/tokyo/viral-10-shaped-bread/69785), a popular street food that we'd seen on TikTok. It was basically a pancake in the shape of a ¥10 coin (that actually costs ¥500) with a big wad of mozzarella in the middle that stretches super far when you bite into it. We didn't purposefully seek it out, but it was there and we decided to give it a try.

Tristan found it a bit bland and overhyped, but Soph, the queen of bland, loved it. Cake and cheese -- what more could a girl want?

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/2" %}

We spent the rest of the day exploring manga stores, trading card stores, and even a retro video game store. We found some old Game Boys, including a limited edition Pokemon one, but decided to hold off on any purchases. We also found a ThinkPad for sale on the street that had its webcam open, so we took a sneaky pic of course.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/3" %}

As we were heading back to our hotel, a young Japanese woman who was standing next to us at the lights gave us a small Pokemon figurine. We're not sure why, but we think she might have gotten it from a capsule toy machine and didn't want it. It was a random but delightful encounter that brightened our day. 

Back at the hotel, we checked in and settled into our room. The bath wasn't as nice as our last place, but it was still a bath, so we were happy. The view was just another building, but we didn't mind. We're just excited to be here, exploring and experiencing new things. 

After checking into our hotel and enjoying some downtime, we decided to explore the local scene. We were lured downstairs by the promise of free drinks, only to find self-serve soft drink vending machines. A bit of a letdown, but hey, we got our fair share of ginger ale and other fizzy delights. We also discovered that the breakfast bar had some promising options like bagels and toast. Noted...

We left the hotel and headed back out to explore Dōtonbori a little more. It was dusk and the last remnants of the sunset fell beautifully on the city.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/3.2" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/3.2-part-2" %}

Our next stop was supposed to be an Australian pub we'd found online, but alas, it was closed. We were a bit bummed out, especially since the website had promised it would be open. But, as we've learned (against our will), travel is all about adapting, so we decided to try out a random place that promised cold beer. It turned out to be more of an oyster bar, and while the lime sour and beer were decent, the grilled corn was overpriced. We left in search for a decent dinner. We spotted some Kobe beef in a window and it looked so marbled and delicious.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/4" %}

But then, we hit the jackpot. We found Oko, a vegan/vegetarian Okonomiyaki place (thanks TikTok!) and it was absolutely delicious. We arrived a bit early and had a minor debate about whether we should wait a few minutes before going in. Soph won that round, and we headed up to find only one person ahead of us in line. The owner, Shiho, runs the entire joint by herself and was super sweet and accommodating. She does everything she can to accommodate dietary requirements and allergies -- we can't recommend this place enough if you are at all picky.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/4.1" caption="She really knows her market -- broke white people." %}

The restaurant was tiny but such a vibe -- Total Drama Island was playing on the TV, and the walls were covered in stickers and drawings. The restaurant can get loud so there are megaphones at the tables further away that you can use to call her over and order.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/4.2" caption="It's impossible to have a bad time when the walls are pink." %}

We ordered gyoza and okonomiyaki. Soph loaded her okonomiyaki with potatoes, carrots, asparagus, spinach, and green onions. She also opted for full cheese, which meant her okonomiyaki was smothered in American cheese (as every meal would be if she had her way). Tristan went for the teriyaki chicken okonomiyaki with half cheese. The drinks were a steal at ¥180 each (about $2 AUD), and we filled up on Asahi beer, whiskey highball, and a mysterious clear liquid that tasted like a vodka mix. The cool thing about the drinks system was that you could fill it up yourself at the tap -- you just had to yell "I'm getting another one!" at the owner and she would say "はい!" (yes) and it would be added to our bill. A flawless system if you ask us. We demolished/devoured/delighted in our meals and praised the gods of TikTok that recommended this place to us.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/5-part-2" %}

We left Oko feeling pretty tipsy and full of praise for the owner. It was so cheap for such a filling meal and we were so grateful to another incredible plant-based restaurant in another city. We had wanted to try okonomiyaki for ages, and we were chuffed to find a place that served both vego and meat options that we could both enjoy.

On our way back to the hotel, we stopped by FamilyMart for more drinks and picked up another lemon-scented bubble bar for our baths. We also got a facial moisturizer for Tristan because, well, he deserves it. We strolled through Dōtonbori, took some pictures, and even stopped by Starbucks to check out some potential gifts for our family and friends.

Tomorrow we're off to Universal Studios!

# Day 11: Universal Studios Japan
Our day started early, around 6:30 AM, with a refreshing hot shower and a quick prep for our much-anticipated visit to Universal Studios. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/7" %}

We grabbed some snacks from Lawson and hopped on a train. With a small GPS mishap, we eventually made it to Universal Studios. We waited eagerly at the entrance for about 45 minutes before they let us in. We even helped a group of tourists snap a photo in front of the Universal Studios gates. If you're planning on visiting Universal Studios and want to get on a ride before big lines form, it's worth getting to the entrance at least 40 minutes before opening. If you're traveling with JTB, you get to enter 30 minutes earlier than everyone else and enjoy the rides before the crowd pours in.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/7.1" %}

We made it through the gates and we were eager to get on our first ride of the day. Soon after getting in line for the Hollywood Dream, we were pulled aside by a staff member who led us to a locker room. We were confused at first -- we thought she was taking us to put our bags away or something. It turned out that they had a test seat for bigger people to try and see if they would fit. Tristan fit in fine but it was too big for Soph, so they had to leave the ride. We were grateful that the test seat was out of sight of other people, but it was still beyond embarrassing and disheartening. Japan is full of small people, and as a person who wouldn't be that out of place in Australia, you're made to feel like a fat giant in Japan if you wear anything above a size 12. We took a walk through tears to discuss whether to continue and try our luck or just leave the park entirely.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/7.2" %}


Our first ride of the day was the Hollywood Dream. But, we hit a snag. One of the staff members pulled us aside and led us to a locker room with a test seat for the ride. Tristan fit in just fine, but I, Soph, didn't. The harness wouldn't go all the way down. It was a bit of a blow, to be honest. I've never not fit into a rollercoaster seat before. It was embarrassing, and I shed a few tears behind a closed stall. It was hands down the worst part of our trip so far.

After pulling myself together, we decided to stay and make the most of our day. We had paid a good amount of money to be there, and leaving would have just made the day worse. We found out that other plus-size people had better experiences with other rides, so we decided to give it another shot.

Our next ride was the Spider-Man ride, a mostly VR experience that was absolutely thrilling. We had a fast track, so we didn't have to wait long. The seats were comfortable, and the ride was a blast. It reminded us of how fun rides can be and made us eager to try more.

We then ventured into Super Nintendo World, which was a sight to behold. The surroundings and props were impressive, straight out of a Mario game. We tried the Koopa's Challenge ride, a Mario Kart virtual reality ride. It was fun, but not as good as the Spider-Man ride. We also tried to get on the Yoshi's Ride, but unfortunately, I didn't fit into the seat again.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/8" %}

In Harry Potter World, we lined up for the Forbidden Journey ride. We were a bit nervous about the seats, but we decided to give it a shot. We were pleasantly surprised when we fit in just fine. The ride was a bit intense, but we really enjoyed it. The highlight for us was the extremely jarring Japanese voices for all the characters. At the finale of the ride, all of the characters are standing in a line, thanking us, the riders, for saving the day. Hearing Harry Potter look us dead in the eye and say "Arigato gozaimasu" was a moment we'll never forget.

After the ride, we decided to eter Ollivander's wand shop, in which we were all huddled together in this dimly lit room, surrounded by shelves filled with wand boxes. The actor, who was playing the role of Ollivander, was speaking in English but also paused to give the Japanese translation after each sentence. He was clearly an extremely talented American actor, and he seemed completely fluent in Japanese! 

He was explaining the importance of the wand choosing the wizard, et cetera, when suddenly, he pointed at a young Japanese girl in the crowd and asked her to come forward. He handed her a wand and asked her to perform a simple spell. The girl, looking a bit nervous, waved the wand and said the spell. Suddenly, a shelf full of wand boxes tumbled down! Ollivander quickly took the wand back, assuring her that it wasn't the right one for her. He then handed her another wand and asked her to try again. This time, when she waved the wand, the room lit up with a warm glow and a gust of wind blew through the room. Ollivander declared that the wand had chosen her. It was a magical moment, even though we knew it was all part of the show. It was a fun spectacle, with lights exploding and items moving around the store. The chosen person even got to keep the wand that was a good fit for them.

We then ventured into the wand shop, where we had planned to buy our own wands. I had taken a quiz on the train ride there that matched our personalities to specific wands. Mine was supposed to be Ebony with Phoenix hair, 12 and a half inches long. Unfortunately, they were out of stock of Ebony wands. After some consideration, I decided not to buy a wand at all. They were quite expensive and I realized it would probably just end up collecting dust on my shelf at home. 

We then moved on to the merchandise section. I was tempted to buy a Hufflepuff scarf, but Tristan reminded me that I could probably knit one myself. So, we decided to save our money and just bought a small time turner magnet as a souvenir. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/9" %}

Next, we decided to go on the Jaws ride. It was a fun experience, with our boat being hunted by a giant shark. The captain of our boat was a real character, shooting at the shark with a shotgun and creating a lot of excitement. 

After the ride, we tried to make a reservation for skiing lessons over the phone. Unfortunately, we ran into some language barriers and weren't able to make the reservation. We decided to look online for other options, but we weren't too upset about it. We figured we could always go tobogganing or something else fun if we couldn't find skiing lessons. 

To celebrate our unsuccessful attempt at making a reservation, we treated ourselves to some delicious pork ribs. We then decided to get some pizza for dinner. We ordered four slices, expecting them to be Australian-sized slices. However, we were surprised when we were given four box sets, each containing a quarter of a pizza and a drink. It was a bit of a miscommunication, but we decided to just go with it and enjoy our meal. 

Despite the language barriers and a few minor setbacks, we had a great time at Universal Studios Japan. We learned a lot, had some fun experiences, and made some great memories. We can't wait to see what the rest of our trip has in store for us!
After our pizza shop debacle, we decided to wander around a bit more, checking out the last of the shops. But honestly, most of the stuff was pretty gimmicky. The shirts weren't printed well and it all felt a bit like a tourist trap. So, we left the park with just a magnet, memories, pictures, and bellies full of food we didn't really want. Despite the ups and downs, we both agreed it was a good day overall. 

I was particularly proud of myself for handling a tough experience in the morning. I allowed myself to feel upset, took the time I needed to process my feelings, and then made a logical decision about whether to stay or go. I was so grateful to have Tristan there to talk it out with. If I'd been alone, I would have left in a heartbeat, feeling completely unwelcome. But we stayed, and we had some good experiences on rides, met some nice people, and had some good food. 

We left the park and wandered into a Gap store, which was a first for me. Nothing really caught my eye, so we hopped on the train and headed home. During our transfer from the train to the subway, we faced a choice: take the escalator or climb three flights of big steps. I decided to take the stairs, and Tristan joined me. It was tough, but I made it to the top and felt really proud of myself. 

I realized that I can't base my self-worth on whether or not I can fit in a roller coaster seat that was made for people much smaller than me. I have a lot to offer this world, and my body has nothing to do with that. 

We also had a funny experience with a really scary ride called Dinosaur. It looked like you went upside down for half the ride, and I was apprehensive about going on it. But I decided to see if I could fit in the chair. The staff member was super nice and tried to make it work, but it just wasn't happening. I was actually relieved because I didn't really want to go on the ride. The staff member was really cool about it and said something reassuring that none of the other people had said. He said the ride was made for Japanese people, not implying that it was my fault for not fitting. 

So, despite some hard lessons, we learned a lot. Now we're just going to relax, enjoy the rest of the day, and prepare for our last full day in Osaka. We're keen to have a good shopping day and maybe get some gifts for other people. Until next time!

# Day 12: Shopping in Osaka

Yesterday, we had a bit of a late start, waking up around 9:30 am. It was our shopping day, so we got ready and headed out to Dotonbori. Soph had her heart set on a cheese coin, and Tristan was all about the takoyaki, but alas, we were a bit short on coin change. So, we decided to give that a miss and instead, we strolled through Dotonbori, popping into a few shops. Unfortunately, nothing really caught our eye, mainly because there weren't many plus-size clothing options. 

We then made our way to America Mura, but not before stopping at Don Quixote. This place was a treasure trove! Soph found some lipstick, and Tristan managed to snag a hat that actually fit his huge head. We also picked up some new earrings. The shop was massive, with six floors of goodies. Checking out was a bit of a challenge with the long lines and the tax-free confusion, but we managed to save about 10% on our purchases, which was a win!

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/8" %}

Next, we stumbled upon this adorable sticker shop in Amerikumura called B-side label. They had so many unique designs, and I even found a shirt that I absolutely loved. The lady at the checkout was incredibly sweet and seemed genuinely impressed with our attempts at speaking Japanese. She even gifted us a free sticker as a token of appreciation from the people of Japan. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/9" %}

We continued our shopping spree, exploring vintage clothing stores and finding a cute, colorful jumper from Paragraph. It was a bit pricey, but we found it cheaper in another shop, so Soph decided to go for it. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/10" %}

After all that shopping, we were famished, so we hit up McDonald's. Tristan tried the barbecue soy sauce burger with bacon, and Soph stuck to her fries and melon Fanta. We realized too late that we should have just ordered a meal, but hey, you live and you learn!

We decided to call it a day on the shopping front, having spent a bit more than we'd planned. Back at the hotel, we chilled out, did some laundry, and I even treated myself to a beer in the bath. 

For dinner, we decided to splurge on some Kobe beef at a place we found on TripAdvisor. It was a grill-your-own-meat kind of place, which was a fun experience. We ordered our meats from an iPad on the wall and enjoyed some mega lemon sours. Soph even tried a piece of my Wagyu steak and admitted it was pretty good!

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/11" %}

We ended the night at an Australian pub, where we chatted with the owner, Osaka Jo, who had lived in Australia for five years. It was refreshing to have a full-on conversation in English with someone other than each other. We had lots of drinks, shared some Vegemite cheese toast, and even scored some free buttery nipple shots with some fellow Aussies. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/osaka/12" %} 

We stumbled back to our hotel around 12:30 am and crashed.
