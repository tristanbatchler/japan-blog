# Day 5: Off to Kyōto
We started our day bright and early in Tokyo, packing up our stuff in record time - just about an hour. By 8, we were ready to bid farewell to our favorite breakfast 
spot in this part of Tokyo (Doutor). We savored our last cheese toast there, and Tristan washed his down with a refreshing apple juice while Sophie enjoyed her matcha latte. We left with satisfied smiles and full bellies, ready to take on the day.

Our next stop was the government building, a brisk 20-minute walk away. It was the coldest morning we've experienced in Tokyo so far, but we braved the chill, eager to take in the view from the observation deck. However, we arrived a bit too early - the deck only opened at 9:30, and we were there by 9. With our check-out time looming at 11 and our Shinkansen train to catch at 12:20, we decided not to wait around. We didn't want to risk messing up our schedule, so we 
made the tough call to leave.

On our way back, we managed to score some train tickets. After a bit of fumbling around, we finally figured out how to use our JR pass properly and get free 
tickets. It was a small victory, but we were thrilled. With our tickets in hand and our train departure time set, we felt a sense of accomplishment. We were 
actually doing this!

As we neared our hotel, we decided to treat ourselves to a little something - Miruku Cocoa　(ミルクココア) (what we thought was "miracle", but it turns out is just "milk"). It's basically hot chocolate, but oh-so-delicious. It was the perfect way to warm up and end our morning.

After a cozy hot chocolate session, we retreated to our hotel room for a bit of Markiplier. Tristan, got a good scare at one point, even though I should've seen it coming. We warmed up, checked out of the hotel (which was surprisingly easy), and then headed to the subway. We almost lugged our bags down the stairs, but two kind ladies, who didn't speak a word of English, pointed us towards an elevator. It took us a moment, but we finally got the message and thanked them.

We made our way to the station and hopped on the subway. We were lucky enough to snag some seats and enjoyed a ride through the outer suburbs of Tokyo. Sophie stood for a bit, but eventually found a seat. I had a bit of a mishap when the train accelerated and my bags, which were on wheels, went flying towards a group of schoolgirls. I had to quickly retrieve them and do the 'walk of shame' to my seat. My bag is enormous, like a boulder, really.

We took another train for one stop and ended up at the station, two hours late. We're now waiting for the Shinkansen, but there seems to be some delays due to the snowfall in Kyoto last night. We haven't seen any official delay on the screen yet, but a fellow traveler mentioned it might be about 10 or 15 minutes. Some trains to Tokyo are delayed by two hours, which is crazy!

But hey, we've got all day, so we're not too worried. We're just sitting here, enjoying some onigiri. I went for a pickled plum one, while Sophie opted for a tuna mayo. We also have some iced coffees and a can of chip star potato chips in mild salt flavor. So, here we are, sitting in the station, waiting for our 
next adventure. Stay tuned!

Our last update had us waiting at the Shin-Yokohama station for the Shinkansen, the bullet train. With a little help from a kind stranger, we managed to find our way to the correct terminal and hopped on board. We had two seats to ourselves and a stash of snacks, including Shinkansen lollies and potato chips. The train ride was a blur of speed and beautiful sights, and we were out of Tokyo before we knew it.

The weather started to darken, but not before we caught sight of the majestic Fuji-san. We both gasped at the sight of it, and no photo could ever do it justice. It was breathtaking, literally. As we continued our journey, the weather took a turn, and before we knew it, we were surrounded by snow. It was a magical sight, like something out of a postcard. The train had to slow down due to the snow, but we didn't mind. It gave us more time to appreciate the beauty of the Japanese countryside blanketed in white.

As we neared Kyoto, we wondered if we would see snow there too. As we stepped out of the station, our question was answered. It was snowing! Neither of us had ever seen snow fall from the sky before, and it was a special moment. We navigated through the snow with our luggage, taking care not to slip on the icy patches. It was a bit of a struggle, but we made it to our hotel, the Solaria Premium Hotel, which was located on a beautiful river bank.

The hotel was lovely, and we were excited to find out that it had an onsen, a traditional Japanese hot spring. We planned to try it out the next morning. After settling into our hotel, we couldn't resist the urge to explore the snowy city. We found a restaurant that served vegetable gyoza, but it turned out to have scallops in it. So, I settled for steamed vegetables with oyster sauce, while Tristan had a barbecue pork rice bowl.

We also had a fun encounter with a multilingual waiter who was a big Radiohead fan. We found a vegetarian gyoza place that we planned to visit the next day, 
and we also stumbled upon a shopping place where we found a cool guitar shop. We bought a capsule toy for Tristan's dad and planned to get a guitar strap for Tristan.

After a bit more exploring, we ended our day by the river, watching the beautiful flow of the water. We planned to head back to our hotel, have a bath, and relax with some videos. The next day, we planned to visit the bamboo forest, try the vegetarian gyoza, and maybe even ride some bikes if the weather was nice. And of course, we were looking forward to trying out the onsen.

So, that's it for now. We're off to continue our adventure. Catch you later!
