# Day 6: Off to Kyōto
We started our day bright and early in Tokyo, packing up our stuff in record time - just about an hour. By 8, we were ready to bid farewell to our favorite breakfast 
spot in this part of Tokyo (Doutor). We savored our last cheese toast there, and Tristan washed his down with a refreshing apple juice while Sophie enjoyed her matcha latte. We left with satisfied smiles and full bellies, ready to take on the day.

Our next stop was the government building, a brisk 20-minute walk away. It was the coldest morning we've experienced in Tokyo so far, but we braved the chill, eager to take in the view from the observation deck. However, we arrived a bit too early - the deck only opened at 9:30, and we were there by 9. With our check-out time looming at 11 and our Shinkansen train to catch at 12:20, we decided not to wait around. We didn't want to risk messing up our schedule, so we 
made the tough call to leave.

On our way back, we managed to score some train tickets. After a bit of fumbling around, we finally figured out how to use our JR pass properly and get free 
tickets. It was a small victory, but we were thrilled. With our tickets in hand and our train departure time set, we felt a sense of accomplishment. We were 
actually doing this!

As we neared our hotel, we decided to treat ourselves to a little something - Miruku Cocoa　(ミルクココア) (what we thought was "miracle", but it turns out is just "milk"). It's basically hot chocolate, but oh-so-delicious. It was the perfect way to warm up and end our morning.

After a cozy hot chocolate session, we retreated to our hotel room for a bit of Markiplier. Tristan, got a good scare at one point, even though I should've seen it coming. We warmed up, checked out of the hotel (which was surprisingly easy), and then headed to the subway. We almost lugged our bags down the stairs, but two kind ladies, who didn't speak a word of English, pointed us towards an elevator. It took us a moment, but we finally got the message and thanked them.


We made our way to the station and hopped on the subway. We were lucky enough to snag some seats and enjoyed a ride through the outer suburbs of Tokyo. Sophie stood for a bit, but eventually found a seat. I had a bit of a mishap when the train accelerated and my bags, which were on wheels, went flying towards a group of schoolgirls. I had to quickly retrieve them and do the 'walk of shame' to my seat. My bag is enormous, like a boulder, really.

We took another train for one stop and ended up at the station, two hours late. We're now waiting for the Shinkansen, but there seems to be some delays due to the snowfall in Kyoto last night. We haven't seen any official delay on the screen yet, but a fellow traveler mentioned it might be about 10 or 15 minutes. Some trains to Tokyo are delayed by two hours, which is crazy!

But hey, we've got all day, so we're not too worried. We're just sitting here, enjoying some onigiri. I went for a pickled plum one, while Sophie opted for a tuna mayo. We also have some iced coffees and a can of chip star potato chips in mild salt flavor. So, here we are, sitting in the station, waiting for our 
next adventure. Stay tuned!

Our last update had us waiting at the Shin-Yokohama station for the Shinkansen, the bullet train. With a little help from a kind stranger, we managed to find our way to the correct terminal and hopped on board. We had two seats to ourselves and a stash of snacks, including Shinkansen lollies and potato chips. The train ride was a blur of speed and beautiful sights, and we were out of Tokyo before we knew it.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/5" %}

The weather started to darken, but not before we caught sight of the majestic Fuji-san. We both gasped at the sight of it, and no photo could ever do it justice. It was breathtaking, literally. As we continued our journey, the weather took a turn, and before we knew it, we were surrounded by snow. It was a magical sight, like something out of a postcard. The train had to slow down due to the snow, but we didn't mind. It gave us more time to appreciate the beauty of the Japanese countryside blanketed in white.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/6" %}

As we neared Kyoto, we wondered if we would see snow there too. As we stepped out of the station, our question was answered. It was snowing! Neither of us had ever seen snow fall from the sky before, and it was a special moment. We navigated through the snow with our luggage, taking care not to slip on the icy patches. It was a bit of a struggle, but we made it to our hotel, the Solaria Premium Hotel, which was located on a beautiful river bank.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/7" %}

The hotel was lovely, and we were excited to find out that it had an onsen, a traditional Japanese hot spring. We planned to try it out the next morning. After settling into our hotel, we couldn't resist the urge to explore the snowy city. We found a restaurant that served vegetable gyoza, but it turned out to have scallops in it. So, I settled for steamed vegetables with oyster sauce, while Tristan had a barbecue pork rice bowl.

We also had a fun encounter with a multilingual waiter who was a big Radiohead fan. We found a vegetarian gyoza place that we planned to visit the next day, 
and we also stumbled upon a shopping place where we found a cool guitar shop. We bought a capsule toy for Tristan's dad and planned to get a guitar strap for Tristan.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/8" %}

After a bit more exploring, we ended our day by the river, watching the beautiful flow of the water. We planned to head back to our hotel, have a bath, and relax with some videos. The next day, we planned to visit the bamboo forest, try the vegetarian gyoza, and maybe even ride some bikes if the weather was nice. And of course, we were looking forward to trying out the onsen.

So, that's it for now. We're off to continue our adventure. Catch you later!

# Day 7: Exploring Kyoto
Our day started with a bit of a split. I, Tristan, woke up early and decided to visit the Onsen, a traditional Japanese hot spring. Sophie, on the other hand, decided to catch up on some much-needed sleep. The Onsen was a steamy, relaxing experience, and I even got to share a bath with a couple of old Japanese dudes. After a refreshing soak, I went for a walk, grabbed a coffee from a vending machine, and did some stretches. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/9" %}

Meanwhile, Sophie woke up to a bit of a mishap. She pulled a muscle in her back while trying to lift her suitcase. Despite the setback, we decided to venture out for breakfast. We found a Melbourne-style cafe after a 15-minute walk and enjoyed some focaccia with butter and apricot jam, minestrone soup, and a caramel yuzu latte. 

Our next stop was the bamboo forest. We decided against biking due to Sophie's back and the icy conditions, so we took two subways instead. The journey was surprisingly simple, thanks to our JR pass. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/10" %}

The bamboo forest was a sight to behold, but the icy conditions made it a bit of a challenge. We had to tread carefully to avoid slipping, and the crowd of tourists didn't make it any easier. Despite the challenges, we managed to enjoy the beauty of the bamboo forest. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/11" %}

We also stumbled upon a place selling vegetable gyoza at Arashiyama Station. We couldn't resist and had to stop for a bite. The deep-fried vegetable gyoza was absolutely delicious and highly recommended. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/12" %}

Our adventure continued with a visit to an estate that belonged to an old Japanese silent movie actor from the early 1900s. The estate, which was more like a Zen temple, offered breathtaking views of Kyoto and the surrounding mountains. The garden was covered in thick snow, making it even more beautiful. 

We spent about an hour exploring the estate, taking photos, and even enjoying some tea and biscuits at the tea house. Afterward, we headed back down, taking a different route through the bamboo forest and stopping for more veggie gyoza. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/13" %}

We ended our day with a visit to a temple and a garden, where we had to take off our shoes. The temple was beautiful, and we even saw a fish jump out of the water. We also saw some koi, lots of screaming children, and little snowmen that people had formed. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/14" %}

As the day turned into night, we hopped on a tram packed with people and made our way back to the hotel. We stopped at FamilyMart for some snacks and decided to have a chill night, considering the day's adventures. 

We're considering ordering in for dinner and taking it easy tonight. We've had a full day, and we're beat. But we're loving every minute of our first travel adventure. Until next time, folks!

# Day 8: The aquarium and the gyozas
Day 7 of our Japan adventure started with a hearty breakfast at a French cafe. I (Tristan) had a thin smoked sausage with two fried eggs, a side salad (which I didn't touch, because, well, why would I?), and a couple of potatoes. Sophie, on the other hand, indulged in a delicious French onion soup. The highlight of the meal, though, was the bread. Oh, the bread! They had a cheese bread that was simply divine. We also enjoyed a juice and a hot coffee, which they kept refilling.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/15" %}

As we were leaving, we had a bit of an odd encounter with a pair of women who seemed to find us amusing for some reason. We didn't stick around to find out why. Instead, we quickly paid and left, only to be stopped by a knock on the window. Turns out, we'd left our scarf behind. 

Next, we hopped on the subway to visit the aquarium. The journey was a bit of a trek, especially with the snow, but it was worth it. The aquarium was a wonderland of marine life. We saw a giant Japanese salamander, a pile of cuddly Chinese salamanders, seals, spotted seals, and even a community of penguins with their own love drama. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/16" %}

The jellyfish collection was particularly fascinating. They had a display showing the growth stages of jellyfish from day one to two months. The variety of species and their different characteristics were truly mesmerizing. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/17" %}

We also visited two main aquarium tanks, one representing the Kyoto River and the other the ocean. The latter was more exciting with sharks, manta rays, and a large school of fish that moved in unison whenever a shark swam by. 

We had a bit of a hiccup when we realized we'd booked our tickets for the wrong day. But the staff was incredibly kind and helped us sort it out. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/18" %}

After the aquarium, we grabbed a quick snack. I'm currently on a hot dog kick, so I had one of those, while Sophie enjoyed a cinnamon pretzel-like treat. 

Later in the evening, we had a minor disagreement about our lack of planning. We decided to do better and made a list of places to visit. One of them was a basement bar with a great vibe. We had a bit of a language barrier issue when trying to order vegetarian food, but we managed with the help of a translation app. 

Our day ended with a visit to Chow Chow Gyoza, a place we found on Happy Cow. The vegetarian set menu was a delight, and we left with our bellies full and hearts content. 

So, that's the recap of our Day 7 in Japan. Despite the occasional trouble, we're having the time of our lives figuring things out and exploring this beautiful country. Stay tuned for more of our adventures!

In our latest adventure, we decided to try a drink that was recommended on a podcast. It was a red-eye, a drink that's not often ordered, as we found out from the confused look on the waitress's face. We sat at the bar and ordered our drinks, mine being a salted red-eye. The waitress asked us if we knew what 'Kampai' meant, and we proudly responded, "Of course we know Kampai!" We clinked our glasses together and took a sip. The drink was surprisingly good!

After finishing our food, we decided to try some hot sake. It was served in a small bottle, about the size of a juice box, and it was strong, almost like wine. We enjoyed it so much that we left a five-star review. 

As we left the bar, we noticed that the snow had gotten thicker. It was a beautiful sight, as we hadn't seen snowfall that thick in Japan before. We decided to head back to our hotel and visit the onsen. The onsen was full of people, but we didn't mind. We just focused on relaxing and enjoying the warm water. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/19" %}

After the onsen, we went back to our room and watched some Game Grumps before falling asleep. The next morning, we woke up early and headed out for breakfast. We initially wanted to go to a place called Smart Coffee, but there was a long wait, so we decided to go to a cafe called Dotoi instead. 

We enjoyed our breakfast and then headed out to explore the Kyoto National Garden. The snow was melting, and it was a beautiful sight.

We ended our day with a walk through the garden and a cup of good coffee. We both chose a South American blend, which was delicious. We're looking forward to more adventures and will update you after lunch. Until then, bye!

# Day 9: Switching it up
Yesterday, we started our day at a park, soaking in the sounds of Triple J Hottest 100 (an Australian radio countdown). We didn't leave the park, but instead, we decided to tour the Kyoto Imperial Palace. It was a quiet, serene experience, with only a few people around. We strolled around the gardens, admiring the buildings where emperors once met with important people. We learned about the fascinating games the nobles used to play, like floating a sake cup down a stream and coming up with an improv poem before it floated past them. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/20" %}

After the palace, we decided to walk to our favorite gyoza place for lunch. It was a 45-minute walk, but we enjoyed every minute of it, just chatting and taking in the sights. The staff remembered us from the night before, which was a fun surprise. We indulged in mushroom risotto gyoza with melted cheese on top and Chuan pork gyoza. 

After lunch, we had a bit of a hiccup. We had to check into our new accommodation, but we didn't realize we had to check in at a different location. After a bit of frustration and a taxi ride, we finally got settled in. We were pretty exhausted from the day, so we had a low-key night, enjoying some snacks from FamilyMart and a long bath.

We wanted to make our own futon, but after much research, decided one of the sheeds was not included. We ended up sleeping in the western style bed, which was very comfortable, but we messaged our host to ask about the futon to which they promised to bring it the next day.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/21" %}

The next morning, we decided to rent bikes and head to Philosopher's Path. We had a bit of trouble figuring out the bike rental app, but we managed to get it sorted. We stopped at FamilyMart for some energy drinks and energy jelly (which we highly recommend!) before setting off on our bikes.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/22" %}

We made it to Philosopher's Path and decided to explore a nearby temple. The view from the top was breathtaking, with a panoramic view of Kyoto and the mountains. We also picked up a magnet as a souvenir of our time in Kyoto.

On our way back down, we couldn't resist the allure of a potato tornado and candied strawberries from a street vendor. We also visited a resaurant on the way back, and Sophie was hoping to try the macaroni and French fries sandwich, but it turned out the macaroni salad had tuna in it. She had to settle for some hot chips, which she absolutely loves anyway. Tristan, on the other hand, went for a Philly cheesesteak andhe  said it was really good. The woman serving us spoke excellent English, which was a relief, especially when you're trying to navigate a vegetarian diet in a foreign country.

As we left the restaurant, we spotted a man with two beautiful dogs, a cross between a Spaniel and a Golden Retriever. They were a deep mahogany color, and we couldn't help but admire them. We then hopped back on our bikes and decided to take a scenic route by the river. The ride was bumpy due to the recent snow, but it was a lovely experience, coasting down the hills and soaking in the quieter streets of Kyoto.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/23" %}

We then came across a path across the canal, made up of stepping stones. We parked our bikes and decided to cross the canal on foot. It was a bit of a challenge for me, having to jump from one stone to another, while Tristan, with his longer legs, managed to step across easily.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/24" %}

As we rode back to the parking place, we noticed groups of people in matching outfits. We were puzzled at first, but then we figured they might be auditioning for a J-pop idol dance troupe at a nearby theater. We liked that theory and decided to stick with it.

We then rode through a massive red Japanese traditional gate, which was quite a sight up close. As we continued our ride, we had a bit of a mishap. Tristan managed to overtake a parked car just in time before a bus came by, but I wasn't so lucky. I had to stop and wait for the bus and a few cars to pass before I could catch up with Tristan.

After our bike ride, we decided to make curry for dinner. We stopped at a local store to pick up some ingredients, but we couldn't find any stock cubes. Tristan then went to another store, Fresco, while I headed back home. Shopping at Fresco was a bit of a challenge for Tristan as there was not a single word of English in the store, but he managed to get everything we needed.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/24" %}

We then cooked our curry, which turned out to be a bit under seasoned due to the lack of salt, but it was still good. We even had leftovers for breakfast the next day. After dinner, we went out again to get some snacks. We walked over a small bridge near our accommodation and headed to the FamilyMart where we stocked up on strawberry flavored ice creams and drinks.

We then spent our last night in Kyoto enjoying our snacks and each other's company. We also made our futon, which was a bit of a challenge as the sheets didn't quite fit, but we managed. It was really spacious and comfortable, and it felt like we were having a sleepover.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/25" %}

We ended the night watching Markiplier play Dead Space, which was quite a thrill. All in all, it was a day full of adventure and fun, and we can't wait to see what tomorrow brings.
