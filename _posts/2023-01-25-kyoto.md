# Day 6: Off to Kyōto
We started our day bright and early in Tokyo, packing up our stuff in record time - just about an hour. A quick fit check:

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/1" caption="It's giving Garfield." %}

By 8:00 am, we were ready to bid farewell to Shinjuku -- but we couldn't leave without one final visit to our favorite breakfast spot, Doutor. Thankfully it's a franchise so this certainly wasn't our last serve of cheese toast, but the staff were always lovely. It felt bittersweet to already be moving on to a new city.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/1.1" %}

Our next stop was the Tōkyō Metropolitan Government Building (東京都庁, AKA Tochō), a chilly 20-minute walk away. It was the coldest morning we've experienced in Tokyo so far, but we braved the chill, eager to take in the view from the observation deck.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/1.2" caption="Tochō in all its glory." %}

However, we arrived a bit too early - the deck only opened at 9:30, and we were there at 9. With our check-out time looming at 11:00 am and our Shinkansen train to catch at 12:20 pm, we decided not to wait around. We didn't want to risk messing up our schedule, so we 
made the tough call to leave.

On our way back to the hotel, we stopped at Shinjuku Station to secure our train tickets ahead of time. It was a bit of a steep learning curve, but after a bit of fumbling around, we finally figured out how to use our JR pass properly and get free tickets. It was a small victory, but after yesterday's kerfuffle, we were thrilled to have a win. With our tickets in hand and our train departure time set, we felt a sense of accomplishment. We were 
actually doing this!

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/2" caption="The last of the sunny weather for the next few days." %}

As we neared our hotel, we decided to take advantage of the abundance of vending machines that Japan has to offer and treat ourselves to a little something - Miruku Cocoa　(ミルクココア) (what we thought was "miracle", but it turns out is just "milk"). It's basically hot chocolate, but oh-so-delicious. The vending machine kept them hot too, so it had the added bonus of keeping our hands warm.

{% include video.html video_id="D80RPxBIM9U" %}

After a cozy hot chocolate session, we defrosted in our warm hotel room, got our bags together and checked out of the hotel. The process was super easy -- we just had to press a button on a touch screen in the lobby. We made our way to the subway and almost lugged our bags down the stairs, but two kind ladies, who didn't speak a word of English, pointed us towards an elevator. It took us a moment, but we finally got the message and thanked them.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/3" caption="We got really good at waiting for trains by the end of this trip." %}

Once on the subway, we were lucky enough to snag some seats and enjoyed a ride through the outer suburbs of Tokyo. Tristan had a bit of a mishap when the train accelerated and his bags, which were on wheels, went flying towards a group of schoolgirls. He had to quickly retrieve them before we had a lawsuit on our hands, and even managed to squeak out an apology in broken Japanese.

{% include video.html video_id="XPPW-SKlTVw" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/3.1" %}

Now at a new station, we were waiting for our first Shinkansen of the trip. We felt like kings living in luxury while waiting in the heated passengers only area -- it had its own small store full of cheap snacks. We stocked up on some onigiri and coffee and settled in.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/3.2" %}

Before we knew it, our Shinkansen was about to arrive. With a little help from a kind stranger, we managed to find our way to the correct terminal. Tristan was a champion and lugged both of our suitcases up the stairs, which he did for the rest of the trip.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/4" caption="Luckily he never skips leg day."  %}

We were early enough to see our very first Shinkansen roll into the station. It was surreal seeing this marvel of engineering in person.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/5" %}

Boarding was easy - we put our luggage in their compartment at the back of the carriage and enjoyed the legroom of our comfy seats. The train was pretty empty, so it was nice to feel like we weren't getting in anybody's way. We settled in for the ride and we soon departed the station.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/5.1" %}

About half an hour into our journey, we caught an unexpected glimpse at the iconic Mt. Fuji (富士山, pronounced Fujisan, which translates to Mr. Fuji). Mt. Fuji is notoriously hard to spot because it is often blanketed in fog, so our hopes for seeing it, especially on the train, were low. Our surprise only added to our excitement -- the older Japanese businessmen sitting nearby must have rolled their eyes at our shocked gasps and incessant camera clicking.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/5.2" caption="No words." %}

Little did we know that this wasn't the only time we would be in awe on this train trip -- a short while later the weather darkened and white fields and trees started to appear - snow!! The forecast was true and we were stoked. The train had to slow down due to the snow, but we didn't mind. It gave us more time to appreciate the beauty of the Japanese countryside blanketed in white.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/6" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/6-part-2" %}

Our two hour train trip had transported us from the bustling city of Tokyo to the winter wonderland of Kyoto. We basically sprinted out of the station to experience snow falling from the sky for the first time ever.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/6.1" %}

We navigated through the snow with our luggage, taking care not to slip on the icy patches. It was a bit of a struggle, but luckily our hotel was only a short walk from the station. We made it to our hotel, the Solaria Premium Hotel, which was right on the esplanade of a beautiful river bank. This was one of the nicer hotels we had booked for our trip, so we were really looking forward to checking in.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/7" %}

The hotel was lovely, and we were excited to find out that it had an onsen, a traditional Japanese hot spring. After settling into our hotel, we dropped our bags off at our room and made our way back outside to explore the snowy city.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/7.1" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/7.1-part-2" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/7.1-part-3" %}

We had dinner at a small asian fusion restaurant near the river -- nothing special, but we did get a kick out of our waiter who was a big Radiohead fan (like us). We did some more exploring after dinner and got some cool photos of Kyoto at night.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/7.2" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/7.2-part-2" %}

We even found a cool guitar store in a nearby shopping area. Soph got her Dad a capsule toy from a vending machine. Gift for Dad - check!

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/8" %}

Eventually we ended our day by the river, watching the beautiful flow of the water (and sinking some tinnies too -- you can take the Aussie out of Australia, but you can't take the Australia out of the Aussie). We headed back to hotel to relax (in a big Japanese bath, of course) after a big day of travel and planned to visit the bamboo forest and try out the vegetarian gyoza restaurant.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/8.1" %}

# Day 7: Bamboo Forest and Tenryū-ji
Tristan got an early start and decided to visit the Onsen in the hotel. It was a steamy, relaxing experience, despite sharing the bath with a couple of old Japanese dudes. After a refreshing soak, he went for a walk, grabbed a coffee from a vending machine, and did some stretches. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/9" caption="Sunrise in snowy Kyoto." %}

Soph, on the other hand, decided to catch up on some much-needed sleep. She was still asleep when Tristan got back to the room. Typical.

A bit later on, Soph lifted her suitcase and pulled a back muscle. After resting for an hour or so, she was a bit better so we ventured out for breakfast. The snowy Kyoto streets were stunning in the morning sun.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/9.1" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/9.1-part-2" %}

We found a Melbourne-style cafe, [Common Well](https://www.instagram.com/commonwell_kyoto/?hl=en), after a 15-minute walk and enjoyed some focaccia with butter and apricot jam, minestrone soup, and a caramel yuzu latte. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/9.2" %}

After breakfast, we were keen to make our way to Arashiyama Bamboo Grove (better known as the Bamboo Forest). We decided against biking because of Soph's back and the icy conditions, so we took two subways instead. Thanks to our JR passes, the journey was painless and free.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/10" %}

We reached Arashiyama (嵐山) Station and found this gorgeous art installation nearby. It's called the Kimono Forest and is composed of 600 poles covered in kimono fabric. The poles form a trail to Tenryū-ji Temple (天龍寺). We didn't have time to visit the temple, but we did enjoy the art installation.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/10.1" caption="Pink is definitely his colour." %}

To our delight, on the other side of the station were a number of food vendors serving delicious Japanese food. Soph was beyond excited to find her very first vegetable gyoza of the trip, so we both got a serving of that. It was deep fried and served with a sweet and sour sauce -- absolutely delicious.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/10.2" %}

The bamboo forest was a sight to behold, but the icy conditions made it a bit of a challenge. We had to tread *veeeerrry carefully* to avoid slipping, and the crowd of tourists didn't help. Regardless, the forest was beautiful. The bamboo trees are so high and their soil was peppered with snow.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/11" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/11-part-2" %}

Our adventure continued with a visit to a sprawling, lush estate that belonged to Ōkōchi Denjirō (大河内 傳次郎, 1898-1962), a Japanese silent movie actor. The estate is at the end of the winding forest paths and costs ¥1000, around $10 AUD per person. The cost deterred most tourists, so the snow was mostly untouched and it was quiet in the best way.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/11.1" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/11.1-part-2" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/11.1-part-3" %}

The estate was at the top of the hill too, so the views were *incredible*.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/12" %}

We spent about an hour exploring the estate, taking photos, and even enjoying some tea and biscuits at the tea house.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/13" %}

Afterward, we headed back down, taking a different route through the bamboo forest. By now we had worked up an appetite, so we found a different place to eat. Tristan found some fried chicken and Soph got a potato croquette.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/13.1" %}

We were delighted to see some blooming cherry blossoms nearby, which was surprising because we were about a month early for cherry blossom season.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/13.2" %}

With Soph's hangriness under control, we finally managed to peel ourselves away from gawking at the flowers and walked around Arashiyama in search of somewhere else to explore. There are temples abound here, and we quickly stumbled upon Tenryū-ji (天龍寺), a 678-year-old Japanese buddhist temple that featured three beautiful buildings and Sōgen Pond (曹源池), which was full of koi. The temple grounds originally contained around 150 sub-temples, but all of them have been destroyed. Temples in Japan are particularly susceptible to fire, and this temple was most recently rebuilt around 1900. Today, only traces of the original design remain.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/14" %}

We took off our shoes to walk inside the main building -- it was surreal walking on the tatami mats and admiring the intricate paintings on the walls, doors and ceiling. We didn't take many photos inside because we wanted to be respectful.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/14.1" %}

The grounds were covered in a thick layer of snow, and the lake was clear enough to catch glimpses of the koi every now and again.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/14.2" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/14.2-part-2" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/14.2-part-3" %}

As the day turned into night, we made our way back to the station and hopped on a tram packed with people. The payment system was confusing, but we managed to figure it out without pissing off too many Japenese people. We stopped at FamilyMart for some snacks and decided to have a chill night after such a long day. Here is Tristan with his second-favourite snack, tuna onigiri.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/14.3" caption="His favourite snack is Sophie, of course." %}

For dinner we decided to go with an easy vegetarian dinner, italian. It felt a bit weird eating pizza in Japan, but the restaurant was nice and the service was great. After the day that we had, we just wanted something that was easy. We even had some wine, which was very unlike us (Soph usually opts for a G&T, while Tristan is a beer guy through and through). But, when in Rome (in Japan)!

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/14.4" %}

Even though we were dead tired, that didn't stop us from exploring more of Kyoto late at night (we blame the wine). We crossed the bridge and went to Book Off, Japan's answer to EB Games. Soph found some cool Japanese Batman and Star Wars paraphernalia, while Tristan was glued to the Yu-Gi-Oh and anime sections. He has a Dark Magician shirt from Yu-Gi-Oh, so it was cool to see its actual card. We didn't end up buying anything, but it was cool to see the things we love in Japanese.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/14.5" %}

On our way back to the hotel, we saw a restaurant that served horse meat (and was very proud of it, too). You do you, Japan.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/14.6" caption="I beg to differ." %}

We soon headed back to the hotel for our nightly ritual -- snacks, beer and a bath. What a great day.

# Day 8: The aquarium and the gyozas
The morning started with a hearty breakfast at a French cafe, [Café Bistrot Aux Bons Morceaux](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Café+BISTROT+AUX+BONS+MORCEAUX/@35.0115492,135.7628289,16z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sfrench+cafe+kyoto!3m6!1s0x600108940105c7eb:0xd64cd755a2722e91!8m2!3d35.009569!4d135.7699633!15sChFmcmVuY2ggY2FmZSBreW90b1oTIhFmcmVuY2ggY2FmZSBreW90b5IBBmJpc3Ryb5oBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VSb04yWTNja2xCRUFF4AEA!16s/g/1tfmn8_4?entry=ttu). Soph was instantly sold on the bread - waiters roam around with a basket full of different types of bread, and you can have as many as you'd like. They even had a bread with bits of cheese baked into it - if you go here, we definitely recommend getting that one if you love cheese. For the main meals, Tristan had a smoked sausage with two fried eggs, a side salad (which he didn't touch, because, well, why would he?), and a couple of potatoes. Soph indulged in a delicious French onion soup, which was cheesy and delicious. We also enjoyed a juice and a hot coffee, which they kept refilling.

As we were leaving, we had a bit of an odd encounter with a pair of women who seemed to find us amusing for some reason. We didn't stick around to find out why. Instead, we quickly paid and left, only to be stopped by a knock on the window. Turns out, we'd left our scarf behind. 

Next, we hopped on the subway to visit the aquarium. The journey was a bit of a trek, especially with the snow, but it was worth it. A quick fit check, of course:

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/15" %}

After a quick journey on the subway, we arrived at the aquarium. We had a bit of a hiccup at the start because we booked tickets for the wrong day, but with the help of Google Translate's voice translate function, they arranged a refund and we purchased new tickets. They were so helpful and understanding even with the language barrier.

After getting the ticket fiasco sorted, we were in. It didn't take Soph long to find another animal to make her entire personality - the Chinese Giant Salamander. One of the largest amphibians in the world, they're native to China and were introduced to the Kyoto Prefecture in the 1950s. Sadly they're critically endangered, so it was cool to read about the Aquarium's conservation efforts. Soph fell in love with them because they pile on top of each other. The picture on the left is a Japanese Giant Salamander, and the dog pile on the right is all Chinese Giant Salamanders.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/16" %}

Next we moved on to the seals. The tank housed both fur seals and earless seals, but the earless seals were sleeping so they were out of the action. The fur seals were so active, always jumping in and out of the water to pose for photos, zoom underwater and steal a fish from the handlers. We could've watched them for hours. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/16.1" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/16.1-part-2" %}

The penguin area was next. We were delighted to see little cape penguins - native to South Africa, so they're comfortable in Kyoto's climate of warm summers and cold winters. They all had their own names, like Taco (たこ), and we saw this amazing map of the penguins' relationships (the penguins and handlers they love, hate, and their children). Tristan even had a staring contest with one of them (the penguin won, of course).

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/16.2" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/16.2-part-2" %}

We then came indoors to the Sea of Kyoto section, which houses around fifty species of fish, stingrays and Japanese pilchards (small fish that move in unison in a large school) in their 500 ton tank. The tank is 9 meters deep and 22 meters wide, so it was pretty impressive. When we were in the early stages of planning our trip this was one of the first attractions on our list, so it was really cool to see it in person. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/17" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/17-part-2" %}

Next up was the jellyfish -- wow. We had never seen some of these species before and it was mesmerising to see them up close. They even had a display showing the growth stages of jellyfish from day one to two months, which was really cool to see.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/18" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/18-part-2" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/18-part-3" %}

After seeing those little floaty guys, we reached the last section of the aquarium - the Finding Nemo Cast and Others section (that's what we assume it's called anyway). So cool to see clownfish in person as well as the other cool species that had on display. They also had some amazing jellyfish pendants hanging from the ceiling!

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/18.1" %}
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/18.1-part-1" %}

We made our way home after finding a cool little cafe that was housed in an old train. Tristan had a hot dog and Soph devoured a cinnamon pretzel.

We stopped off at our hotel room to squeeze in a quick nap before heading off to explore the smaller laneways nearby. They were full of small, family-owned restaurants that were a delight for the senses (nose and eyes in particular).

For dinner we took a chance on an inviting basement restaurant. They use an app that customers have on their phone to take orders, but we needed a phone number that could accept texts to do that. Because we were relying on Wifi only to avoid roaming fees, that wasn't an option. The waiter eventually just gave us his phone to order, which is when we discovered this was yet another restaurant that didn't have a ton of great vegetarian options. The waiter was really helpful (with the assistance of Google Translate, again) and Soph enjoyed some grilled veges on the grill.

It wasn't super filling so we decided to try another place. This time, we researched vegetarian options on google and found a decent-looking gyoza place, ChaoChao Gyoza in Shijo-Kawaramachi (四条河原町). We eventually found it and knew it would be delicious because it was packed with only white people (being plant based is white people behaviour, of course). We had to wait for a short while because it was super popular - luckily we were able to wait inside.

This place was incredible. The kitchen is out in the open so you chat with the staff while they work. They had a set menu that was a sight for sore eyes:

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/18.3" caption="As soon as we saw the Fried Cheese we knew we were home." %}

Every single bite of the gyoza was a trip to heaven. We each had a set menu, and we had every kind of gyoza covered between us. Because Tristan wasn't as hungry, Soph got to try all the gyoza. Between that, the friendly staff and the general fun vibe of the restaurant, this was a real highlight of the trip.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/18.4" %}

Tristan ordered a Red Eye, which is made of beer and tomato juice. It sounds weird because it is - the confused look on the waitress's face when he ordered it was priceless. Tristan took one sip and immediately regretted his choice (boys, amirite?).

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/18.5" %}

We also ordered warm sake, something we had both wanted to try the entire trip, and thankfully it was much tastier than the Red Eye. The waitress asked us if we knew what 'Kampai' meant, and we proudly responded, "Of course we know Kampai!" We clinked our glasses together and took a sip. It was strong, almost like wine, but tasty nonetheless.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/18.6" %}

We were reluctant to leave because it was so much fun drinking, eating and chatting to the staff, but lucky for us the good times didn't stop there. We walked out and it was snowing so heavily! It was so thick and powdery - after the experience we just had, we felt like we were in a movie.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/18.7" %}

We decided to head back to our hotel and visit the onsen. If you're not familiar, onsens are public baths that are a hallmark of traditional public baths before modern plumbing was invented. It's very normal in Japanese culture, and as bath lovers, we wanted to give it a go. We couldn't go together as men and women bathe separately, rightfully so.

You need to be fully naked and shower before and after the bath to keep it clean. We were a bit nervous at first, but once you get over the initial shock of being naked in front of strangers, it's a really relaxing experience. The water is heated by the natural hot springs in the area, and in our hotel there was a bath both inside and outside. We both opted for the outside bath as the cold winter air was a nice contrast to the hot water. We both really enjoyed it and would definitely do it again.

We regrouped outside of the bathing area and headed back to our room. The night was a much-needed win after many lacklustre vegetarian meals. Japanese people are known for their incredible cuisine, not for their incredible *plant-based* cuisine. It felt reassuring to finally find a place that enthusiastically served food that fit Soph's dietary needs. We were so full and relaxed that we fell asleep almost instantly.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/19" %}

After the onsen, we went back to our room and watched some Game Grumps before falling asleep. The next morning, we woke up early and headed out for breakfast. We initially wanted to go to a place called Smart Coffee, but there was a long wait, so we decided to go to a cafe called Dotoi instead. 

We enjoyed our breakfast and then headed out to explore the Kyoto National Garden. The snow was melting, and it was a beautiful sight.

We ended our day with a walk through the garden and a cup of good coffee. We both chose a South American blend, which was delicious. We're looking forward to more adventures and will update you after lunch. Until then, bye!

# Day 9: Switching it up
Yesterday, we started our day at a park, soaking in the sounds of Triple J Hottest 100 (an Australian radio countdown). We didn't leave the park, but instead, we decided to tour the Kyoto Imperial Palace. It was a quiet, serene experience, with only a few people around. We strolled around the gardens, admiring the buildings where emperors once met with important people. We learned about the fascinating games the nobles used to play, like floating a sake cup down a stream and coming up with an improv poem before it floated past them. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/20" %}

After the palace, we decided to walk to our favorite gyoza place for lunch. It was a 45-minute walk, but we enjoyed every minute of it, just chatting and taking in the sights. The staff remembered us from the night before, which was a fun surprise. We indulged in mushroom risotto gyoza with melted cheese on top and Chuan pork gyoza. 

After lunch, we had a bit of a hiccup. We had to check into our new accommodation, but we didn't realize we had to check in at a different location. After a bit of frustration and a taxi ride, we finally got settled in. We were pretty exhausted from the day, so we had a low-key night, enjoying some snacks from FamilyMart and a long bath.

We wanted to make our own futon, but after much research, decided one of the sheeds was not included. We ended up sleeping in the western style bed, which was very comfortable, but we messaged our host to ask about the futon to which they promised to bring it the next day.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/21" %}

The next morning, we decided to rent bikes and head to Philosopher's Path. We had a bit of trouble figuring out the bike rental app, but we managed to get it sorted. We stopped at FamilyMart for some energy drinks and energy jelly (which we highly recommend!) before setting off on our bikes.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/22" %}

We made it to Philosopher's Path and decided to explore a nearby temple. The view from the top was breathtaking, with a panoramic view of Kyoto and the mountains. We also picked up a magnet as a souvenir of our time in Kyoto.

On our way back down, we couldn't resist the allure of a potato tornado and candied strawberries from a street vendor. We also visited a resaurant on the way back, and Soph was hoping to try the macaroni and French fries sandwich, but it turned out the macaroni salad had tuna in it. She had to settle for some hot chips, which she absolutely loves anyway. Tristan, on the other hand, went for a Philly cheesesteak andhe  said it was really good. The woman serving us spoke excellent English, which was a relief, especially when you're trying to navigate a vegetarian diet in a foreign country.

As we left the restaurant, we spotted a man with two beautiful dogs, a cross between a Spaniel and a Golden Retriever. They were a deep mahogany color, and we couldn't help but admire them. We then hopped back on our bikes and decided to take a scenic route by the river. The ride was bumpy due to the recent snow, but it was a lovely experience, coasting down the hills and soaking in the quieter streets of Kyoto.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/23" %}

We then came across a path across the canal, made up of stepping stones. We parked our bikes and decided to cross the canal on foot. It was a bit of a challenge for me, having to jump from one stone to another, while Tristan, with his longer legs, managed to step across easily.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/24" %}

As we rode back to the parking place, we noticed groups of people in matching outfits. We were puzzled at first, but then we figured they might be auditioning for a J-pop idol dance troupe at a nearby theater. We liked that theory and decided to stick with it.

We then rode through a massive red Japanese traditional gate, which was quite a sight up close. As we continued our ride, we had a bit of a mishap. Tristan managed to overtake a parked car just in time before a bus came by, but I wasn't so lucky. I had to stop and wait for the bus and a few cars to pass before I could catch up with Tristan.

After our bike ride, we decided to make curry for dinner. We stopped at a local store to pick up some ingredients, but we couldn't find any stock cubes. Tristan then went to another store, Fresco, while I headed back home. Shopping at Fresco was a bit of a challenge for Tristan as there was not a single word of English in the store, but he managed to get everything we needed.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/uploads/images/kyoto/24" %}

We then cooked our curry, which turned out to be a bit under seasoned due to the lack of salt, but it was still good. We even had leftovers for breakfast the next day. After dinner, we went out again to get some snacks. We walked over a small bridge near our accommodation and headed to the FamilyMart where we stocked up on strawberry flavored ice creams and drinks.

We then spent our last night in Kyoto enjoying our snacks and each other's company. We also made our futon, which was a bit of a challenge as the sheets didn't quite fit, but we managed. It was really spacious and comfortable, and it felt like we were having a sleepover.

We ended the night watching Markiplier play Dead Space, which was quite a thrill. All in all, it was a day full of adventure and fun, and we can't wait to see what tomorrow brings.
