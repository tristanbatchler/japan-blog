# Day 12: Off to Hiroshima
This morning, feeling a little dusty from the night before, we had an underwhelming hotel breakfast. We packed up, left for Hiroshima, and managed to snag aisle seats next to each other on the Shinkansen. 

We had quite the adventure on our train ride to the hotel. We shared a tram carriage with a group of Australian travelers who looked like they were ready for a camping expedition with their massive backpacks. It was a hilarious sight, us foreigners taking up half the tram carriage. When we reached our stop, Tristan tried to tap off with his suica card, but we don't think it worked properly. He got off anyway, only to realize he had gotten off at the wrong stop. The whole tram watching, including a Japanese old man who laughed out loud. It was embarrassing, but hey, we don't know any of these people, so who cares?

We finally made it to our hotel, which was right outside the tram stop. The hotel was fancy, with the reception on the top floor and a beautiful restaurant on the bottom floor. We were a bit early for check-in, but they let us in anyway since the room was ready. The check-in process was a bit lengthy, with the staff explaining all the rules and services, but we were just eager to get to our room.

We were surprised when they asked us if we wanted a room on the top or bottom floor. We obviously chose the top floor, and boy, was it worth it! Our room was beautiful, and we had a stunning view of the Peace Dome from the 13th floor.

Since we only had one full day in Hiroshima, we decided to visit the Peace Museum and the Peace Dome that afternoon. The museum was a sobering experience, with graphic images and stories of the impact of the bomb on Hiroshima and Japan. We also visited the gardens, the Cenotaph, the Children's Peace Monument, and the Eternal Flame. We didn't go up to the Peace Dome as the sun was setting, but we got a good view from across the river.

On our way back, Sophie had a bit of a tumble and landed hard on her shins. It was painful, but she's okay. We also stopped by an orange juice stand and had some freshly squeezed orange juice, even though it was a bit pricey. We then realized we needed a HDMI cable to watch TV in our room, but unfortunately, we couldn't find one at the local 7-Eleven or Lawson.

# Day 13: Miyajima

Yesterday, we had a delightful dinner at our hotel's restaurant. Sophie opted for a margherita pizza while Tristan bravely tried spaghetti with oysters and bacon. We washed it all down with a limoncello gin and tonic for Sophie and a Moscow mule for Tristan. The food was delicious, but the timing was a bit off - the pizza arrived a good 15 minutes before the spaghetti. We didn't mind too much, though.

After dinner, we headed to the hotel's rooftop bar, where we exchanged our room tokens for drinks and nibbles. We soaked in the vibes, enjoyed a few more drinks, and then headed back to our room. Tristan indulged in a long bath while Sophie admittedly fell asleep.

The next morning, Tristan was up early to secure our ferry tickets to Miyajima. The ticket office was manned by a rather intimidating Japanese man who seemed to grow impatient with my indecisiveness about our return time. After some reflection, however, I realized he was probably just trying to be efficient. But we got our tickets, and I grabbed a couple of coffees from 7-Eleven before heading back to the hotel.

We made it to the boat with time to spare, so we sat by the river, enjoying the tranquility before our journey. The boat ride to the island was scenic and peaceful, with a robotic English translation providing a bit of unexpected humor.

Once we arrived at Miyajima, we were greeted by the sight of the island's famous floating gates and our first deer sighting. We explored the island, visiting the temple attached to the floating gates and a spiritual temple up a flight of stairs. We were careful to observe respectfully, not wanting to inadvertently disrespect the traditions.

After a lunch of hot chips for Sophie and pork on a stick for Tristan, we embarked on a hike to a cable car, or "rope car" as it's called here. The journey was a bit strenuous, but the views from the cable car and the summit were absolutely worth it. We even ran into a group of fellow Australian tourists along the way!

Reaching the summit was a moment of triumph for us. We were beyond exhasted, but the breathtaking views made every step worthwhile. We celebrated with our new Aussie friends, taking photos and soaking in the incredible scenery.

This journey is teaching us so much about ourselves and the world around us. We're learning to navigate unfamiliar situations, to push ourselves beyond our comfort zones, and to appreciate the beauty of new experiences. We can't wait to see what the rest of our trip has in store!
After our little break at the summit of Mount Misen, we noticed our new Aussie friends were struggling to take a group photo with their iPhone. Being the good Samaritans we are, we offered to take their photo with our camera. They were thrilled! We snapped a few shots and tried to send them over, but our VPN was acting up. After a quick fix, we managed to airdrop the photos to them. They loved them! We felt pretty good about our little act of kindness.

We decided to head back down the mountain, passing the same group of Aussies we'd met earlier. They jokingly suggested we should follow them around for the rest of their trip, taking photos for them. The descent was tough, our thighs were burning and our knees felt like they were being crushed with every step. But it was much easier than the ascent, and we made it back to the bottom in one piece.

We hopped on a packed cable car to head back down. The views were breathtaking. Once we got off, we walked through the park, spotting some deer and koi fish along the way. We grabbed some hot chips and a skewer of pork tongue (which was surprisingly good) before heading back to the floating gate.

We realized it was low tide and we could walk out to the gate. It was a bit muddy, but we managed to get some great photos. However, when we turned around, we found our path was slightly flooded. I braved the water with my shoes on, but Tristan decided to take his shoes and socks off. He quickly regretted his decision when he realized there was no grass to walk on, just dirt. 

We had to power walk to the boat dock to catch our ride back. We made it with just a few minutes to spare. The Aussies were on the same boat, and we shared a few laughs before everyone settled in for a quiet ride back. They invited us to dinner, but we were both tired and a bit short on cash, so we politely declined.

Back at our hotel, we grabbed some snacks from 7-Eleven and relaxed for a bit. We spent some time planning our trip to Yudanaka the next day, which we knew would be a full day of travel. 

Oh, and a random memory just popped into my head. When we were leaving Osaka to go to Hiroshima, we saw a group of police officers running through the station. It was a bit strange, but we didn't think much of it. 

That's it for today's recap. Can't wait to share our adventures in Yudanaka with you all!
