# Day 14: The long trip to Yudanaka
Yesterday, we woke up bright and early in Hiroshima, bags packed and ready for our long journey to Yudanaka. We hopped on the tram from our hotel to Hiroshima station, then took a train to Shin-Kobe, and another from Shin-Kobe to Nagoya. 

Nagoya was a bit of a whirlwind. We were hungry and decided to grab some Maccas. We must have looked like lost gaijin (foreigners) because a kind man approached us, and led us to the restaurant. He didn't speak much English, and our Japanese is pretty basic, but we managed to communicate and make some small talk. We weren't sure why this stranger was helping us, but it became clear when we arrived near the restaurant. He opened his bag, revealing a McDonald's employee uniform, and he proudly spoke a single word: "manager". We replied with a hearty "sugoi!" (amazing) and thanked him for his help. Funnily enough, his shift must have been a bit later, because he walked off in the opposite direction once we parted ways.

After our Maccas adventure, we hopped on another train to Nagano. We had a bit of a funny moment when an older lady sitting next to us decided to move seats after we started chatting. We also had a bit of a panic when we couldn't find our train, but a kind local helped us out. 

Finally, we arrived in Nagano, a beautiful station that hosted the Winter Olympics in 1998, which was made apparent by the over-the-top Olympic-themed decorations. We found our line to Yudanaka, which was hidden away underneath the station. It was a tiny train, mostly filled with foreigners like us, heading to the Snow Monkey Park and the ski slopes.

We arrived in Yudanaka around 5:30 p.m., just as the sun was setting. It was snowing, and the roads were icy. We had to walk uphill to our hotel in the dark, which was a bit of a struggle with our suitcases. But we made it, and checked into our traditional Japanese room, complete with tatami mats and futons. The owner was a really nice elderly man who offered to lift our luggage up three flights of stairs for us, but we couldn't accept his offer, since we were much younger and grateful to stay in his ryokan. After lugging our suitcases up the stairs, we were exhausted, but were itching to explore the town.

We had a bit of a scare when Sophie slipped on an icy mat leaving the ryokan. She was okay, but it was quite scary considering how close she came to hitting her head on the tiled step. With a new appreciation for the dangers of icy streets (and our fragile mortality), we headed out to find some dinner, and found a lovely place called Hakko. We enjoyed a mushroom and green onion pizza, butterfries (potato wedges drowned in butter), mackerel, and gyoza. 

Our first day in Yudanaka was a mix of adventure, missteps, and delicious food. We're excited to see what the rest of our trip has in store for us!
We were in a restaurant, enjoying our meal, when we overheard a conversation between an Australian man, a Canadian woman, a Canadian man, and a woman with a European accent. The Canadian man dominated the conversation, his loud voice filling the restaurant. As they left, he kept loudly repeating "number one, number one" to the poor waiter. After paying for dinner and dropping some "gochisosama deshita"s (thank you for the meal), we headed to Lawson, picked up some beer, and returned to our hotel. 

We decided to try on our yukatas, traditional Japanese garments, and enjoyed some tea. It was a lovely experience, and we felt like we were truly immersing ourselves in the culture. 

# Day 15: Exploring Yudanaka
We woke up the next morning, unsure of our plans for the day, but decided to play it by ear.

We got a wakeup call from an oldschool telephone in our room from the owner of the ryokan, who we've been calling Yudanaka Jo (in honour of Osaka Jo). He asked if we were going to the monkey park. We told him we were planning on going skiing instead, and he offered to drive us to the bus station where we could catch the free shuttle to the ski slope. The drive was a bit chaotic, with Sophie's seatbelt getting stuck in the door and Yudanaka Joe driving like a maniac on the icy roads, but we made it to bus station in one piece.

We arrived at the bus station just barely in time, thanks to Yudanaka Jo's speedy driving. The bus ride up the mountain was beautiful, if not slightly scary, with the windy mountain pass and trees and roads covered in thick snow.

Once we arrived, we were a bit lost. We needed to rent equipment and find the training area, but there were no clear instructions. We found an information booth and asked about lessons. The woman seemed confused by our request, but eventually directed us to rent our equipment and then head to a navy blue building at the top of the ski lift to inquire about lessons.

The whole process was a bit stressful and confusing, and we were worried about the cost. We decided to skip skiing and instead decided to just enjoy the scenery and go to the snow monkey park. We were a bit disappointed, but we were excited to see the monkeys.

After about an hour of snowball fights and soaking in the breathtaking views of the mountains, it was time to take the bus back down. At the Yudanaka bus station to the monkey park, we overheard a man arguing with the ticket booth operator about the need for cash to travel. We overheard something about him nearly being stranded in the mountains because he didn't have cash, but the whole thing seemed too bizarre to not be an overreaction. It was another strange encounter in a day full of them. Despite the weirdness, we persevered and got our bus tickets to the monkey park. 

The day had been a bit of a rollercoaster, with one strange encounter after another. But despite the chaos, we were so excited to see the monkeys. We had heard so much about them, and we couldn't wait to see them in person.

Once the bus arrived, we noticed people onboarding would take a paper ticket out of a dispencer on the bus, near the door. We had prepaid tickets, so were a bit confused, but we decided to take the extra tickets just in case. We ended up with four tickets and a lot of questions. Why were some people not taking tickets? Were we even on the right bus? Thankfully, we were on the right bus, but the ride was a bit overwhelming with the sheer number of people.

After a 15-minute ride, we arrived at our destination, only to find out there was a 2.7-kilometer hike up to the Snow Monkeys. We also learned that if you have a prepaid ticket, you don't need to worry about the white tickets from the machine. You just need to make sure you're on the right bus. If you have a white ticket, you pay in cash on the bus as you leave. The price depends on how far you go on the bus.

We had a bit of a hold-up when a group of American tourists in front of us had to pay with cash. They seemed a bit confused about the process, and we all had to wait for them to figure it out. It was relieving to watch other foreigners being confused, so we didn't mind the holdup, but we eventually got off the bus and started our hike.

The hike was a bit challenging due to the icy and snowy path, but we made it to the top. We stopped at a cafe along the way and enjoyed some delicious food. The chicken was even better than KFC! After refueling, we continued our hike and finally reached the Snow Monkeys.

One very strange thing we saw on the walk up to the monkey park was a man, fully nude, bathing in a hotspring which belonged to one of the ryokans in a small village along the way. We were extremely concerned about the hygiene of the water, but also kind of impressed by this absolute chad.

After purchasing our tickets to the park, the sight of the monkeys was worth all the confusion and challenges of the day. They were everywhere, foraging in the snow, climbing on the netting on the side of the mountains, and of course, bathing in the hot springs. We were able to get some great photos and videos of these adorable creatures.

After spending some time with the monkeys, we made our way back down the mountain. We stopped at the cafe again for some ramen and apple pie, and then caught the bus back to our accommodation. This time, we had to pay with coins, but we had figured out the system by then.

We had spotted a restaurant earlier that day, Isekai, and decided to give it a try. The menu outside looked promising, with vegetable tempura and other tantalizing dishes. But, as first-time travelers, we were a bit nervous about what to expect inside. 

We were unsure about the shoe etiquette, a common practice in Japan. In his best broken Japanese attempt, Tristan asked some locals who were having a cigarette outside the restaurant, if shoes were okay (kutsu wa daijoubu desu ka?), and they assured us they were. But as soon as we stepped in, we saw everyone's shoes off! We quickly asked the owner, who kindly reassured us that shoes were fine in the wooden floorboard area. Phew! 

We settled down at the bar, ready to dive into the extensive menu. We ordered a variety of potato and chicken dishes, excited to try authentic Japanese cuisine. But then, a funny thing happened. We were sitting next to each other on the same bench when the owner gestured for one of us to move to the other bench. We were a bit confused, but we complied. We ended up sitting the same distance apart, just on separate benches. It felt a bit odd, but the owner probably just wanted to make sure we were comfortable given we are a bit bigger than the average Japanese person.

The food was absolutely delicious, and we washed it down with a couple of drinks. We were surrounded by a lively group of locals, their laughter and chatter adding to the warm atmosphere. We didn't understand a word, but we loved being part of it. 

After a hearty meal, we made our way back to our accommodation, navigating the icy roads. We were greeted by the owner, who asked about our checkout time. We weren't sure yet, so we decided to call it a night and figure it out in the morning.

Back at our accommodation, we relaxed and reflected on our day. The Snow Monkeys were an amazing experience, but we agreed that unless you're an experienced skier, Yudanaka might not be the best place for a visit. We're city slickers at heart, and we're looking forward to getting back to the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. But for those who love snow and want to experience it, Yudanaka is a good place.
