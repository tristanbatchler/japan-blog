# Day 1: Our First Night in Tōkyō

# Day 2: Our First Full Day in Tōkyō

# Day 3: The Quest for a Cream Puff

Today, we started our day in *Shinjuku* (新宿区), taking some pictures around our neighborhood before heading to a local cafe chain called [*Dotour Coffee Shop* (ドトールコーヒーショップ)](https://www.doutor.co.jp/). We indulged in the thickest, fluffiest cheese toast you could ever imagine. Tristan tried matcha for the first time and loved it, while Sophie stuck to her favorite apple juice.

## The Journey to Shibuya

Our next stop was *Shibuya* (渋谷区), but we got a bit lost trying to find the train station. It was hidden in a weird spot underground, but we eventually found it and hopped on a train to *Yoyogi Park* (代々木公園).

The park was a bit muddy and less maintained than the one we visited yesterday, but it was bustling with people and dogs. We spent a good 20 minutes dog-watching, spotting breeds from huskies to poodles to spaniels. One particular dog caught our attention - a big fluffy dog in a purple onesie, with its fur sticking out from the feet and head. It was quite a sight!

## Meiji Shrine and Dango

After the dog park, we visited the *Meiji Shrine* (明治神宮), a massive park area in Tōkyō that honors the legacy of the Meiji period. The shrine was huge and had a spiritual vibe to it. We were a bit confused about the rituals, but we enjoyed the experience nonetheless.

We also tried *Dango* (団子), a skewer of rice cakes with a sweet soy sauce. It was deliciously puffy and sticky, and we had to hunt for a bin to dispose of the skewer - bins are surprisingly rare here!

## Back to Shibuya and Cream Puff Factory

Our next stop was *Shibuya* (渋谷区), where we planned to visit a perfume factory called [The Flavor Design](https://www.theflavordesign.com/). However, we didn't realize we needed a reservation, so we booked a slot for the next day and headed to the Sky Deck in the Shibuya train station. The view of the city from the 12th floor was breathtaking, and we spent a good 10 minutes soaking it in.

We then decided to visit the [*Cream Puff Factory* in *Shimokitazawa* (下北沢)](https://en.japantravel.com/tokyo/shirohiges-cream-puff-factory/40958). The journey there was a bit confusing, but we eventually made it. Unfortunately, the factory was full, so we had to kill some time in the neighborhood. We stumbled upon a market-like area with tiny restaurants and cafes, and even found a place that served vegetable gyōza (餃子), a dish Sophie had been craving.

Finally, we returned to the Cream Puff Factory and were given a private room. The Totoro cream puff we shared was absolutely delicious, filled with the most delightful strawberry cream. It was a popular spot, with everyone taking selfies with their cream puffs.

## Akihabara Adventures

After our cream puff factory adventure, we hopped back on the train and headed to *Akihabara* (秋葉原), known for its electronics. We found [*Super Potato* (スーパーポテト)](https://www.superpotato.com/), an electronics store, where Tristan tried to find a Game Boy, but they didn't have any. Despite this, we had a blast exploring the store's retro games and navigating its steep stairs. We're fit gods, after all, so we didn't need the elevator.

## Ramen Feast and Electronic Shopping

Next, we stumbled upon a ramen place that offered vegan options. The vegan ramen with soy sauce broth was so good, I couldn't stop raving about it. Tristan had the tonkotsu ramen (豚骨ラーメン), which he also loved. Somehow, the chef knew I was vegetarian, which was a pleasant surprise.

After our ramen feast, we did some more electronic shopping. We scored an SD card on sale and a random SD card adapter for my laptop. We then did a few laps of Akihabara, taking in all the stores and even trying our luck with some capsule toys. I got a Tamagotchi one, and Tristan got a Pokémon one. They weren't exactly what we wanted, but it was fun nonetheless.

## The Camera Store Incident and Further Explorations

We also ventured into a camera store filled with vintage cameras. It looked closed, but the door was open, and the lights were on. Suddenly, a Japanese man appeared, pushing a trolley and telling us the store was only open from nine to five. It was a bit of a shock, considering most places in Tōkyō are open late.

We continued our exploration, spotting a fluffy cat in a cat cafe window and making a few more laps around Akihabara. We then hopped on the train and saw some guys playing football in the middle of the night in the city. It was a strange sight, but also quite fun to watch.



## End of the Day in Shinjuku

We ended our day by getting lost in Shinjuku station, which was a maze of signs and platforms. We eventually found our way out, only to be charged for walking through the station. We laughed it off and headed back to our hotel, stopping at Family Mart for some snacks. I tried a crepe, but it wasn't as good as the cream puff. We also enjoyed some drinks outside the Family Mart, like true degenerates, before heading back to our hotel for a relaxing bath.

## The Nemon Joke and Our Lovely Loot

We had a good laugh over our "*Nemon*" joke, which started when Tristan misread "*lemon*" as "*Nemon*" on a TikTok video. We've been spotting lemons everywhere since then, so when we saw a lemon bubble bar at Lush, we had to get it. The Nemon bubble bar made our skin feel really soft and smelled amazing.

Despite walking almost 20 kilometers and getting a bit of chafe on our legs, we had a fantastic day. We even got a *Spirited Away* cup from a Final Fantasy shop in Akihabara. It was a satisfying day, and we can't wait to see what tomorrow brings. , see you tomorrow!

# Day 4: JR Passes, Imperial Gardens, and off to Kyōto
This day in Tōkyō started early, with Tristan rousing me from sleep at 6:50 am to catch a 7:30 train. Our plan was to swap out our JR passes at Shinjuku, but we soon discovered that the exchange office didn't open until 8 am. So, we hopped back on the train to Tōkyō Station, exchanged our JR passes, and then hit our first snag of the day.

## The Nikko Incident

We had initially planned to visit Nikko, but we soon found out that the line to Nikko wasn't a JR line. The round trip would have cost us a whopping $200, so we decided to change our plans and explore Tōkyō instead. We walked out of Tōkyō Station, apologized to each other for the stress, and then just started wandering around.

## The Imperial Palace and Gardens

Our aimless stroll led us to the Imperial Palace and its surrounding gardens. We also made a pit stop at Starbucks, our first Japanese Starbucks experience! We indulged in a matcha donut, a cappuccino (since they don't have flat whites), and a caramel frappuccino. I also treated myself to a New York cheesecake, which was absolutely divine.

Just as we were enjoying our Starbucks treats, it started to rain. It wasn't heavy enough to warrant an umbrella, but it did last longer than we expected. But hey, a little rain never hurt anyone, right? We then stumbled upon a park where we spotted a lone swan in a river. It was a beautiful sight, and we managed to snap some great photos.

Next, we ventured to the Imperial Gardens. We quickly realized that getting inside the palace area, where the emperor lives, was a bit tricky without a guided tour. So, we stayed on the outskirts, capturing what we could with our cameras. We had hoped to see the ruins, but the tour requirements were unclear, so we decided to leave it for another day.  

As we continued our walk, we came across a man dressed in an all-white suit that resembled a hazmat suit. It was a bit eerie, but we shrugged it off and moved on. We also overheard some fellow Australians, which was a comforting reminder of home.

We then found ourselves in a section of the Imperial Gardens popular with runners. Despite the rain, they were out in full force, sprinting and practicing. We even saw a sign indicating it was a designated area for runners. Tristan jokingly asked if we had to run through the area, but we decided that would be a bit too much, even for Japan.

## The park and the view

After a bit more wandering in the rain, we found ourselves in a different park, where we could see people playing tennis. We climbed some slippery stairs and were rewarded with 
a stunning view of the city. Now, we're just sitting in the park, enjoying the moment. We even had a bit of fun with Tristan trying to answer English questions in Japanese, with a success rate of about 60%.

After a bit more exploring of the park, the sun eventually came out after the rain shower, making everything glisten and glow on the outskirts. It was the perfect backdrop for our adventure.

## Some shopping and a nap

We then headed back to our hotel for a much-needed nap. But before that, we made a quick stop at Casetify. They had some really cool stuff, but it was a bit expensive for our budget so we moved on after some window shopping.

On our way back, we stopped by Family Mart and treated ourselves to some local delicacies. Sophie had a pizza bao, which was absolutely delicious, while Tristan opted for a chicken thigh skewer. We enjoyed our meal back at the hotel, and then it was nap time.

While Sophie took a long nap, Tristan did some planning for our upcoming trip to Kyōto. After our somewhat chaotic morning, we realized we needed to be a bit more organized with our day trips. We also booked tickets for the Kyōto Aquarium, which we're super excited about!

We also discussed renting kimonos, but Tristan is still deciding whether he wants to join in on that fun. We'll see how that goes!

## A night out

After our nap, we ventured out into Shinjuku at night. We took some photos, tried to figure out the Japanese washing machine (which makes no sense to us), and had a few drinks. We also wanted to exchange our coins, but apparently, change machines are pretty rare. So, we'll have to figure that out tomorrow.

We decided to try some sushi from a place where you order from a screen and your food is delivered to your table via a conveyor belt. It was a unique experience, and the sushi was delicious! Tristan discovered he likes tuna sushi. Unfortunately the only thing available for Sophie on her vegetarian diet was cucumber sushi and some french fries. Finding vegetarian food in Japan is a bit tricky, but at least now we're aware, and will hopefully be able to hunt down some more options in the future.

We spent the rest of the night walking around, taking photos, and even got some kawaii photos taken at an arcade. We also saw a cute cat billboard at Shibuya crossing, and a cat cafe, which we almost went into until I accidentally stepped on a tatami mat with my shoes on and got yelled at. Oops!

We ended the night with another trip to Family Mart for some more food and drink outside the shop. At some point, a guy in a truck approached and seemed to want to park exactly where we were sitting. We weren't sure how long he was waiting for us to move, but we eventually got the hint and moved on and headed back to the hotel. We had planned to pack, but we were too tired, so we decided 
to leave it for tomorrow. We did, however, manage to have a bath each, which was a nice way to end the day.

So, that's it for today. It was a pretty chill day, but we're loving every minute of our adventure. Tomorrow we are off to Kyōto, and we can't wait to see what adventures that brings!
