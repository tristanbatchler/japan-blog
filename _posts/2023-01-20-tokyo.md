# Day 1: Our First Night in Tōkyō

# Day 2: Our First Full Day in Tōkyō

# Day 3: The Quest for a Cream Puff

Today, we started our day in *Shinjuku* (新宿区), taking some pictures around our neighborhood before heading to a local cafe chain called [*Dotour Coffee Shop* (ドトールコーヒーショップ)](https://www.doutor.co.jp/). We indulged in the thickest, fluffiest cheese toast you could ever imagine. Tristan tried matcha for the first time and loved it, while Sophie stuck to her favorite apple juice.

## The Journey to Shibuya

Our next stop was *Shibuya* (渋谷区), but we got a bit lost trying to find the train station. It was hidden in a weird spot underground, but we eventually found it and hopped on a train to *Yoyogi Park* (代々木公園). 

![Yoyogi Park](/assets/uploads/images/2023-01-22-yoyogi.jpg)

The park was a bit muddy and less maintained than the one we visited yesterday, but it was bustling with people and dogs. We spent a good 20 minutes dog-watching, spotting breeds from huskies to poodles to spaniels. One particular dog caught our attention - a big fluffy dog in a purple onesie, with its fur sticking out from the feet and head. It was quite a sight!

## Meiji Shrine and Dango

After the dog park, we visited the *Meiji Shrine* (明治神宮), a massive park area in Tokyo that honors the legacy of the Meiji period. The shrine was huge and had a spiritual vibe to it. We were a bit confused about the rituals, but we enjoyed the experience nonetheless.

We also tried *Dango* (団子), a skewer of rice cakes with a sweet soy sauce. It was deliciously puffy and sticky, and we had to hunt for a bin to dispose of the skewer - bins are surprisingly rare here!

## Back to Shibuya and Cream Puff Factory

Our next stop was *Shibuya* (渋谷区), where we planned to visit a perfume factory called [The Flavor Design](https://www.theflavordesign.com/). However, we didn't realize we needed a reservation, so we booked a slot for the next day and headed to the Sky Deck in the Shibuya train station. The view of the city from the 12th floor was breathtaking, and we spent a good 10 minutes soaking it in.

We then decided to visit the [*Cream Puff Factory* in *Shimokitazawa* (下北沢)](https://en.japantravel.com/tokyo/shirohiges-cream-puff-factory/40958). The journey there was a bit confusing, but we eventually made it. Unfortunately, the factory was full, so we had to kill some time in the neighborhood. We stumbled upon a market-like area with tiny restaurants and cafes, and even found a place that served vegetable gyōza (餃子), a dish Sophie had been craving.

Finally, we returned to the Cream Puff Factory and were given a private room. The Totoro cream puff we shared was absolutely delicious, filled with the most delightful strawberry cream. It was a popular spot, with everyone taking selfies with their cream puffs.

## Akihabara Adventures

After our cream puff factory adventure, we hopped back on the train and headed to *Akihabara* (秋葉原), known for its electronics. We found [*Super Potato* (スーパーポテト)](https://www.superpotato.com/), an electronics store, where Tristan tried to find a Game Boy, but they didn't have any. Despite this, we had a blast exploring the store's retro games and navigating its steep stairs. We're fit gods, after all, so we didn't need the elevator.

## Ramen Feast and Electronic Shopping

Next, we stumbled upon a ramen place that offered vegan options. The vegan ramen with soy sauce broth was so good, I couldn't stop raving about it. Tristan had the tonkotsu ramen (豚骨ラーメン), which he also loved. Somehow, the chef knew I was vegetarian, which was a pleasant surprise.

After our ramen feast, we did some more electronic shopping. We scored an SD card on sale and a random SD card adapter for my laptop. We then did a few laps of Akihabara, taking in all the stores and even trying our luck with some capsule toys. I got a Tamagotchi one, and Tristan got a Pokémon one. They weren't exactly what we wanted, but it was fun nonetheless.

## The Camera Store Incident and Further Explorations

We also ventured into a camera store filled with vintage cameras. It looked closed, but the door was open, and the lights were on. Suddenly, a Japanese man appeared, pushing a trolley and telling us the store was only open from nine to five. It was a bit of a shock, considering most places in Tokyo are open late.

We continued our exploration, spotting a fluffy cat in a cat cafe window and making a few more laps around Akihabara. We then hopped on the train and saw some guys playing football in the middle of the night in the city. It was a strange sight, but also quite fun to watch.



## End of the Day in Shinjuku

We ended our day by getting lost in Shinjuku station, which was a maze of signs and platforms. We eventually found our way out, only to be charged for walking through the station. We laughed it off and headed back to our hotel, stopping at Family Mart for some snacks. I tried a crepe, but it wasn't as good as the cream puff. We also enjoyed some drinks outside the Family Mart, like true degenerates, before heading back to our hotel for a relaxing bath.

## The Nemon Joke and Our Lovely Loot

We had a good laugh over our "*Nemon*" joke, which started when Tristan misread "*lemon*" as "*Nemon*" on a TikTok video. We've been spotting lemons everywhere since then, so when we saw a lemon bubble bar at Lush, we had to get it. The Nemon bubble bar made our skin feel really soft and smelled amazing.

Despite walking almost 20 kilometers and getting a bit of chafe on our legs, we had a fantastic day. We even got a *Spirited Away* cup from a Final Fantasy shop in Akihabara. It was a satisfying day, and we can't wait to see what tomorrow brings. , see you tomorrow!
